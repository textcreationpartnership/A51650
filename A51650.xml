            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE many pious Reflections which the Author of <hi>The Search
after Truth</hi> makes in that admirable Book, juſtly induc'd him to believe
that they might be of uſe to demonſtrate the Truth of Chriſtian Religion
by evident Reaſons. Thoſe who follow <hi>Des Cartes</hi> will doubtleſs
allow this to be true; for nothing is ſet down there but what is plainly
prov'd, or what is an axiom univerſally granted. Now as it is of great
importance to convince all ſorts of Perſons of the Conformity of the
Chriſtian Religion with Reaſon, This Author judged that the following
Dialogues might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb facs="tcp:42160:3"/>to that end; Since theſe
Philoſophers ought not to be neglected. But 'tis alſo hop'd that many
others, not ſatisfied with the Proofs deduc'd from old Philoſophy, will be
convinc'd by thoſe that are given here; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided theſe Dialogues be read
with all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that is requiſite to underſtand a work of this
Nature. This is all that is deſired of them, for a ſerious Application of
the mind undoubtedly produces Light.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to anſwer a Thing which ſome Perſons
might think amiſs in the management of this Work; they might ſay that our
young <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is too learned and anſwers Theodorus with two much
ſtrength and Judgment, conſidering his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Years which are
repreſented to be between Fifteen and Twenty. But theſe Gentlemen may
obſerve that our Author ſuppoſes <hi>Eraſtus</hi> to be altogether free
from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; and this ought to be ſuppoſed, ſince <hi>Theodorus</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> chuſe him Judge of their differences: They may
alſo <pb facs="tcp:42160:3"/>conſider that when <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſpeaks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
above his Years, tis only ſome things which he had read in <hi>The Search
after Truth.</hi> And after all, the Deſign of Chriſtian Dialogues is not
that of certain writings made only to indulge the Imagination, but rather to
inſtruſt the Mind; and 'tis much better that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſhould be
admir'd for ſaying Things ſeldom ſpoken by thoſe of his Years, as they
are now Educated, than that he ſhould give us occaſion to laugh at his
Childiſhneſs, or at that Simplicity that ſo well expreſſes the
Character of a young, raw Student.</p>
            <p>There are ſome few Paſſages in theſe Dialogues where the
Author, who is known to be a Roman Catholic, has made his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutors to
ſpeak like Men of that Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But I did not think fit either to
alter or omit any Thing; this being a bare Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ought
conſequently to repreſent the Original as much as Poſsible. Neither did
did I think it neceſſary to confute thoſe <pb facs="tcp:42160:4"/>Paſſages: For,
the Arguments uſed by the Roman Catholicks in behalf of their partica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Doctrines are ſo inconſiderable, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe which this
Author has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to prove the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that at
this Day, they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Proteſtants ſhould loſe Time in
confuting them.</p>
            <p>As for the Tranſlators Part, if you can pardon ſome few Faults
of Print and Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms, of which ſuch Works are ſeldom wholly Free, he
dares aſſure you that he has taken all imaginable Care to give here his
Author's Sence juſt in its full Extent, and as cloſe and clear as it was
poſſible in ſuch abſtracted Notions.</p>

               <speaker>Ariſtarchus.</speaker>
               <p>I Muſt let you know, my dear <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> how little
ſatisfaction our late Conferences have yielded me: I have diſcours'd with
you of my Travels, and ſeveral adventures of my laſt Campaigns; you know
them all, do not ask me any more of them. You told me a word yeſterday, which
made ſuch an impreſſion on me, that I am become inſenſible to all the
things that have hitherto extreamly moved me: I find their Emptineſs and
their Vanity, and will have ſolid Enjoyments and certain Truths.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theodorus.</speaker>
               <p>Give thanks, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> to your deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to him
that breaks your bonds, and changes your heart. I have ſpoke a long time to
your ears, but at laſt he that put words into my mouth, hath made you
underſtand their meaning. You have ſeen Truth, <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42160:6"/>and you
love it; you deſire to ſee it more plainly, that you may love it more
fervently.</p>
               <p>Think not, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that what enlightens, you and
creates in you the deſire you feel now, is a word ſpoke in the air, which
only affects the body, or the <hi>ſenſible man,</hi> uncapable of
underſtanding. How many times have I told you the ſame things, without
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing you of them? I ſpoke then to your ears, but the light of truth
did not ſhine in your mind: or rather, ſince that Light is always within
us, it did ſhine in your mind, but it did not enlighten it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of
your ſelf, you hearken'd to a man who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpake to the Body. You were in
Darkneſs, and would not turn your ſelf towards him who alone can
diſperſe it.</p>
               <p>Learn then, my dear <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> to retire within your
ſelf, to be attentive to Inward Truth; to ask, and receive the anſwers of
our common Maſter; for without it I aſſure you all my words will be
barren, fruitleſs, and like all thoſe I have told you already, which you
hardly can remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſtarchus.</speaker>
               <p>I am willing to do my endeavour to follow you, but I fear I
ſhall not be able to do it; for I have much ado to underſtand well the
things you have told me now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>In the Paſſion that moves you now, you will not fail to give
attention to all the things I'll tell you, but you ſhall not always
underſtand them, your attention will hardly be pure enough, and your
intention ſufficiently free from Intereſt, to be always rewarded with the
clear and diſtinct ſight of Truth.</p>
               <p>The attention of the mind is the natural Prayer we make to Inward
Truth, that it may diſcover it ſelf to us; but this Soveraign Truth doth
not always anſwer <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42160:6"/>our expectation, for we do not know how
to make our addreſſes: We often ask it queſtions without knowing what we
ask; as when we go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve queſtions, whoſe terms we do not
underſtand.</p>
               <p>We ask it queſtions, and then leave it, not waiting for its
anſwers; as when Impatience ſeizes us, and our Imagination is diſpleas'd
that we think on things, that have no relation to the good of the body.</p>
               <p>We ask it queſtions, and ſtrive to corrupt it, as when our
Paſſions move us, and we will have its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to agree with our
opinions.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, we ask it queſtions, we hear its anſwers, and do
not underſtand them; as when our prejudices prepoſſeſs our mind, and it
is fill'd with falſe Ideas, and our Imagination is utterly ſpoil'd by an
infinite number of dark and confus'd notions, that continually repreſent all
things to us with reſpect to our ſelves. Then God ſpeaks and the body
alſo, reaſon and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the mind and the ſenſes; there ariſes
a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe, and nothing can be heard. Darkneſs mixes it ſelf
with Light, and nothing can be ſeen. For we cannot always diſcern what God
tells us <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> and through himſelf to unite us to truth,
from what he tells us through our body to unite us to ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things.</p>
               <p>The various Imployments of your Life have fill'd your mind with a
great number of prejudices, that have imprinted on it a certain Character much
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd in the world, which is but as a Seal that faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens thoſe
prejudices on our minds. You have read much the Books of certain Scepticks, who
are proud of doubting of all things, and yet ſpeak of them perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; and
I fear that, like them, you will have me hereafter prove you common notions,
and receive <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42160:7"/>as principles, opinions altogether unknown to the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of mankind.</p>
               <p>It is alſo much to be fear'd, that your travels have too much
diſperſt your thoughts, and given your mind too much of the Court-air, to
let you hear with attention ſome things altogether unknown amongſt
Travellers and Military men.</p>
               <p>You do not believe at preſent that your Studies and Travels have
corrupted your reaſon, and prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd you with many unreaſonable
opinions. You have ſome cauſe not to believe it, and I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to convince you of it yet: But that hereafter we may reconcile our differences,
let us take for a third a young man, whom the converſation of the World hath
not yet ſpoilt, that Nature alone may ſpeak in him, and we may find who of
us two is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd. Methinks <hi>Eraſtes</hi> who heard us t'other
day, would be very fit for this: I obſerv'd by his countenance that he often
conſulted within himſelf to examine our ſentiments with thoſe of his
Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and always approv'd of the moſt reaſonable; tho he us'd to
ſtand as it were amaz'd and ſurpriz'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judging of any thing, when
ever he heard you relate certain things which you have read in Books.</p>

               <p>You do him a great deal of honour at my coſt, but I can find no
fault with it; that young man is ſo <hi>lovely,</hi> that beſides the tye
of blood, I have all the reaſon in the world to be glad of the eſteem you
have of his Wit. I freely conſent: But here he comes in very good time.</p>

               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>With all our hearts, <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> we were thinking to
ſend for you.</p>
               <p>I have juſt now told you my reſolution, <hi>Theodorus,</hi>
and you approve of it: Let us Philoſophize, I pray you, but let it be after a
Chriſtian and ſolid manner. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me of the Truths, that are
eſſential and moſt capable of rendering us happy.</p>
               <p>How would you prove that there is a God, for I believe that 'tis
by this we ought to begin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>The Exiſtence of God may be prov'd a thouſand ways, for there
is nothing but may ſerve to demonſtrate it; and I wonder how a perſon of
your parts, ſo well read in Antiquity, and ſo accompliſht every way,
ſeems not to be convinc'd of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I am convinc'd of it by Faith, but I muſt confeſs I am not
fully convinc'd of it by Reaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>If you ſpeak as you think, you are convinc'd of it neither by
reaſon, nor by Faith. For do you not know that the aſſurance of Faith
comes from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a God that ſpeaks, and who can never deceive us.
If then you are not convinc'd by reaſon that there is a God, how will you be
convinc'd that he hath ſpoke? Can you know that he hath ſpoke, without
knowing that he is? And can you know that the things which he hath reveal'd us
are true, without knowing that he is Infallible, and never deceives us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do not examine things ſo narrowly; and the reaſon why I
believe it, is becauſe I will believe it, and that I have been told ſo all
my life. But let us ſee your proofs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Your Faith hath much of the man in it, and your anſwers ſhew
much Indifference. I deſign'd to give you the moſt ſimple and natural
proofs of the Exiſtence of God, but I find by the diſpoſition of 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42160:8"/>your mind, they would not be the moſt convincing: You
muſt have ſenſible proofs. Here are many things about us; which of them
ſhall I make uſe of to prove you that there is a God? Shall it be this Fire
that delights us? this Light that illuminates us? the nature of Words, by
whoſe means we diſcourſe together? for, as I told you juſt now, there
is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but may ſerve to ſhew the exiſtence of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, provided
we conſider it with all poſſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>God acts inceſſantly in and by all his works: 'Tis he that
illuminates us by this outward light, that delights us by the warmth of this
fire, and diſcourſes with us when we think we converſe together. God
neither produces nor preſerves any creature, but which may cauſe thoſe to
know him who make good uſe of their reaſon. I will convince you of it
preſently: In the mean time, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> take heed that neither of us
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs you.</p>
               <p>Anſwer me, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> What doth Fire do in you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>It warms me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Then Fire cauſes a pleaſure in you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I own it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>What cauſes in us ſome pleaſure, makes us in ſome

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Then what makes us in ſome manner happy, is in ſome manner our
good; and in ſome manner above us; and deſerves in ſome manner love and
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. What think you of it, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> is Fire in ſome manner
above you? Can Fire act in you? Can it cauſe in you a pleaſure it hath not,
it feels not, it knows not, and cauſe it in you, that is to ſay, in a
Spirit, in a being infinitely above it?</p>

               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do not think ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>See then, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> what you have to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>You conclude too faſt: And I ſee what you drive at. I
diſtinguiſh, Fire cauſes heat, but it doth not cauſe pleaſure.
Pleaſure is a ſentiment of the Soul, which the Soul cauſes in it ſelf:
When its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is well diſpos'd, the Soul rejoyces at it, and its joy is its
pleaſure; but Fire cauſes the heat we feel; for as it contains it in it
ſelf, it can diſperſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Can you conceive, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that your Soul cauſes in
it ſelf its pleaſure, and cauſes it when it knows its body is well
diſpos'd? Can you know what changes happen now to your body? Doth the
pleaſure you receive when you warm your ſelf, delay its coming, till you
find out what paſſes in your hands? Doth it ſtay alſo for the orders of
your Soul? and do you feel that this depends from you as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect depends
from its cauſe? Do you alſo apprehend well that Fire really contains this
heat you feel? This heat you only feel when your hands are out of the Fire; for
whilſt your hands are in the Fire, which according to <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi>
contains heat, you do not feel it, but a very great pain, which perhaps is not
in the Fire.</p>
               <p>When you retire within your ſelf, to conſult your Reaſon, do
you well conceive that Matter is capable of any modifications differing from
Motion and Figure? Do you believe that it is by heat that Fire ſeparates the
particles of Wood when it burns it? That by heat it agitates the particles of
Water when it makes it boyl? That by heat it purifies Metals when it melts
them? Extracts Water out of Mud <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42160:9"/>when it drys it? Drives with
violence Cannon-balls, and overthrows by Mines the Walls of Cities, and the
higheſt Towers? In ſhort, have you ever found in Fire ſome effect that
may prove it is poſſeſſ'd of heat?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs I cannot eaſily underſtand how this heat I feel is
capable of producing any of the effects you have now mention'd: And I cannot
even ſee any relation between this heat, and any of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Fire. I
have ſufficiently experienc'd by its effects that Fire hath motion, but I
have not found yet that it hath heat.</p>

continually divided, and its particles move themſelves from the Chimney

               <p>I will preſently, <hi>Eraſtus.</hi> But by the way,
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> have you compared your anſwers with thoſe of
<hi>Eraſtus?</hi> Have you obſerv'd how he applies himſelf, how he
conſults the Maſter that teaches him in the deepeſt receſs of his
reaſon, he never anſwers but after him, he warrants nothing but what he
ſees; and for that reaſon I defie you to draw directly any falſe
conſequences from his anſwers. But if you <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42160:10"/>mind it,
thoſe that you made me before to the ſame queſtions, may in a manner
juſtifie the Religion of thoſe who place Fire, or the Sun among the Gods.
For if Fire or the Sun can reward and puniſh you, make you happy or unhappy,
they muſt be above you, they muſt have power over you, and you ought to pay
ſubmiſſion to them; for it is an inviolable Law that inferiour things
ſhall be ſubſervient to ſuperiour. I need tell you no more of it: I
only aſſure you, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> never reaſoned like
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and that in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they argu'd like you, ſince
we ſee by their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they have followed the ſame thred of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences I have drawn now from your Anſwers.</p>
               <p>Obſerve it, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> when God ſpeaks, when
inward Truth anſwers, there is no creature but guides us to the Creator.
You'll underſtand this well here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But when we judge raſhly of things,
without conſulting any other maſter than our imagination, or the doctrine
of certain falſe-learned, 'tis impoſſible for us to come near God.</p>

anſwers inſtruct me more than the high rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of our Philoſophers;

               <p>I will go on then with my queſtions to <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
ſince you are ſo well pleaſed with hearing him. Hear me my dear
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> you told me juſt now, that Fire can move variouſly the
particles of your hand, becauſe <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42160:11"/>bodies can act on bodies.
You believe then that bodies have a power to move thoſe they meet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>My Eyes tell me ſo, but my mind doth not tell me ſo yet, for I
have not yet examined that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, anſwer me; Hath a body power to move it ſelf?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do not believe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Is then the power that moves bodies diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from
theſe bodies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Take notice, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that I do not ſpeak of motion.
The local motion of a body is a kind of being of that body, with reſpect to
thoſe that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: I do not ſpeak of that, but of the power which
cauſes it. I ask you if this power is ſomething that is corporeal, and if
it is in the power of bodies to communicate it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do not believe it, for if it were any thing corporeal, it would
not be able to move it ſelf. No, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> I do not believe that
bodies can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to thoſe they meet, a power which they have not
themſelves; a power they could not communicate though they had it: In
ſhort, a power whoſe diffuſion and communication they could not be able
to direct in a manner as regular as is that which we ſee; ſince bodies do
not even know either the bigneſs or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe they meet. It ſeems
to me, that an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent being, and one and the ſame intelligent being,
muſt produce and regulate all the motions of matter, ſince the
communication of the motion is always the ſame in the ſame accidents. For
all bodies or many intelligent beings, would not eaſily agree together to act
always after the ſame manner in the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of motions.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42160:11"/>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks <hi>Eraſtus</hi> runs too faſt and loſes
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For it ſeems to me, that thoſe things which are always done the
ſame way, are not done by an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent being, but by a blind action,
<hi>caeco impetu na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You miſtake your ſelf, <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is not out; and you
ought not to attribute to a blind impetuoſity, that which comes from the
immutability of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature. I ſee you do not know that 'tis the
mark of an excellent workman to produce admirable effects, by acting always
after the ſame manner, and by the moſt <hi>ſimple</hi> means. I will not
undertake to lead you to God that way; it is too difficult, and does not afford
us a notion of God ſo uſeful to morality. I would diſcover him to you as
the <hi>Sole Author</hi> of the felicity of the Juſt, and of the miſery of
the Wicked, and in a word as being alone able to act in us. For I ought not
only to demonſtrate to you that he is, (which certainly is but ſeldom
doubted of) but I ought alſo to demonſtrate to you that he is our good in
all reſpects, for that's a thing which is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known.</p>
               <p>I return to <hi>Eraſtus.</hi> You are perſwaded, my dear
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that neither Fire, nor the Sun, nor any one of thoſe
bodies that ſurround you, are the true cauſes of what you feel at their
preſence; and in this you are wiſer than all thoſe who have worſhipped
Fire or the Sun. You do not even believe that bodies have any natural power to
move thoſe they meet; and in that too you ſee more clearly than thoſe who
worſhip the Heavens, the Elements, and all thoſe bodies which
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> call'd divine, becauſe he believed they had in them a
power to move themſelves, and to produce by this motion all the good or evils
whereof men are <pb n="14" facs="tcp:42160:12"/>capable. But it is not ſufficient to know
that bodies do not act on you, you muſt alſo diſcover the true cauſe of
all that is produced in you. You feel warmth and pain at the preſence of
Fire. Now Fire doth not produce this warmth and this pain in you. What muſt
it be then <hi>Eraſtus?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs to you that I know nothing of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not your ſoul who acts on her ſelf; who afflicts her
ſelf, when Fire ſeparates the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the body ſhe loves? or who
rejoyces when the ſame fire produces in her body a motion proper to keep you
alive, and help the circulation of the blood?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do not believe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe the ſoul doth not know that the fire moves or
ſeparates the fibres of the body. I felt heat and pain before I had learnt by
the reflections I made what fire is able to produce on my body: And do not
believe that Clowns, who know nothing of what fire doth operate in them, are
free from pain when they are burnt. Beſides, I do not know what is the motion
that is proper to keep me alive, and help the circulation of the blood. And if
I were to feel no heat till I knew it, perhaps I ſhould never feel any. In
ſhort, when I happen to burn my ſelf by inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I feel pain before
all things. I might perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, by the pain I feel, that there is in my
body ſome motion at work which offends it; but 'its evident that the
knowledge of thoſe motions neither precede nor cauſe any pain.</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Your Reaſons, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> are altogether ſound. But
what think you of them <hi>Ariſtarchus?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42160:12"/>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>They ſeem to me probable enough. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>
how can you tell but that your ſoul hath a certain knowledge of inſtinct,
which diſcovers to her in a moment all that happens in her body? Anſwer me,
<hi>Eraſtus</hi>—Anſwer me quickly then. 'Tis a ſtrange thing you
never anſwer me readily.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do not underſtand your meaning; but all that I can ſay to
you is, that when I know actually ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I am ſure that I do know it,
for I am not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from my ſelf. If my ſoul had actually
ſome knowledge of inſtinct, or whatſoever other you pleaſe (for I don't
underſtand that word very well) I ſhould know it. Yet now that I come near
the fire, I do not know that I have the knowledge of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are
actually produced in my hand, tho I feel in it ſometimes a pain, and
ſometimes a kind of pleaſure or titillation. There is not then actually in
my ſoul a knowledge of inſtinct, nor any other. I cannot tell if you are
ſatisfied.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But little truly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Shall I tell you why you are not well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 'Tis becauſe
<hi>Eraſtus</hi> hath made a clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent anſwer to an Objection that
was not ſo. If you clearly underſtood what you object, <hi>Eraſtus</hi>
would anſwer you both clearly and quickly. If hereafter you deſire to
receive from him more ſatisfaction than you have had hitherto, conſider
well what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ask him. He cannot anſwer you ſpeedily and clearly
when he doth not underſtand you, and you do not even underſtand your
ſelf. He uſes all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, not to anſwer but when he hath
conſulted inward truth, and had its anſwer, but it never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers him
when he doth not know what he asks. Yet you would have him give you an
anſwer, and that <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42160:13"/>ſpeedy too. If he made you any he
would deceive you; for it would be his anſwer, and not Truths you ſhould
receive.</p>
               <p>I will ſtill put ſome queſtions to him, that you may
obſerve the method I think is proper to go about it, and that his anſwers
may inſtruct you of the Truth we ſeek.</p>
               <p>I have obliged my ſelf, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> to prove the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of God by the effects which fire ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us; but to
do it, 'tis of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to know that 'tis not the ſoul
that cauſes in her ſelf her own ſenſations. See if you have not ſtill
ſome other proof, I do not ſay more ſolid, but more able to convince
<hi>Ariſtarchus.</hi> Think on it—Why do you ſometimes ſuffer a
pain? Do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I underſtand you, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> I am not to my ſelf the
cauſe of my happineſs nor of my miſery. If I was the cauſe of the
pleaſure I feel, ſeeing I love it, I ſhould always produce ſome in me.
And on the contrary, if I was the cauſe of the pain I ſuffer, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I
hate it, I would never produce it in my ſelf. I perceive that there is a
ſuperiour cauſe that acts on me, and may make me happy or unhappy: Since I
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act on my ſelf, and that bodies produce not in me the ſenſations
which I feel, as we ſaid juſt now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>You have it not right, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> you love your Body; you
either know or feel that there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſome good or ill to it; you either
rejoyce or are afflicted at it: The one is your pleaſure, and the other your
pain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>What ever <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> ſays to me, puzzles me, and
throws me into darkneſs. I beg of you, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> to diſperſe
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42160:13"/>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I do not wonder at it, <hi>Eraſtus.</hi> Whatever he tells you
is falſe or full of obſcurity, yet ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough.</p>
               <p>Will you never retire within your ſelf, <hi>Ariſtarchus?</hi>
How can you conceive, I pray you, that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> loves his body?
Whatever is within <hi>Eraſtus</hi> that is able to love, is better than the
body of <hi>Eraſtus; Eraſtus</hi> knows it. His Body cannot act on his
Soul, he knows it; his Body cannot be his Good, he knows that too: it cannot be
properly ſaid then that he loves it. But here lies the riddle,
<hi>Eraſtus</hi> loves pleaſure more than his body; and he reſents
pleaſure when his body is well diſpos'd: 'Tis that obliges him to mind his
body, and to defend it when any thing offends it. Do you think the Drunkards
love their body, when they gorge it with Wine? Do you think the Libertines love
their body, when they ruine their health? Is it not rather becauſe they love
the preſent pleaſure? Do thoſe who morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their body, love it when
they tear it, or do you believe they hate it? What is it then they love, but
the pleaſures they hope one day to enjoy? What do they hate on the contrary,
but the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torments they fear to ſuffer?</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee, that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> doth not cauſe in
himſelf his pleaſure, becauſe he finds, or is ſenſible that the body
he loves, is well diſpos'd. For he doth not even know that his body is in a
good ſtate, by any other thing than by the pleaſure he hath by it. It is
true, that when we feel by pleaſure or by pain that our body is well or ill
diſpos'd, we are affected with joy or grief; but if you think on it
ſeriouſly, you will eaſily perceive that this grief and joy that are the
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our knowledge, differ mightily from thoſe antecedent pains and
pleaſures of which we ſpeak. <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42160:14"/>Therefore they muſt have
ſome other cauſe than our ſelves. Do you grant it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I am now convinced of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Now this cauſe muſt be ſuperior and always preſent to us,
ſince it acts within us. This cauſe can puniſh or reward us, make us
happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; ſince pleaſure delights us, and pain diſpleaſes and
makes us uneaſie. If then this Cauſe were God, we ſhould know that God
doth not only rule the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavens: But that he hath a hand in our
concerns; rules whatſoever paſſes in us; and that in order to our
happineſs, we ought to fear him, love him, and follow his orders. For ſince
he makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual applications to us, he requires ſomething from us; and if
we do not perform what he requires from us, 'tis not likely that he ſhould
reward us, and make us happy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I own it. But how would you prove that it is not ſome Angel or
Demon that hath the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of us, and acts on us? How would you prove that
there is a Being infinitely powerful, and who includes in his being all the
perfections imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? This ſeems to me very difficult.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>It is difficult, by the method I have taken; but when we
acknowledge a ſuperior power that acts in us, we have not much difficulty to
conſider him as Soveraign, and to allow him all the perfections of which we
have ſome idea. Nevertheleſs I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to convince you fully.
Mind me alſo <hi>Enaſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as we are prick'd with a Thorn we feel pain. This pain
doth not proceed from the Thorn nor from the Soul; you grant all this: it
proceeds then from a ſuperior power. This power ought to know the moment when
the Thorn pricks our body, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42160:14"/>that he may in the ſame moment
produce the pain in our ſoul. But how ſhall he know it? Think on
it—He cannot know it from us; for we know nothing of it yet. Nor from the
Thorn; for the Thorn cannot act on the ſpirit of that power, nor repreſent
it ſelf to him; for the Thorn is neither viſible nor intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by it
ſelf, there being no relation between bodies and intelligent beings. Whence
then ſhall this ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power learn the moment when the Thorn pricks us?
If you tell me that he ſhall know it from ſome other intelligent being, I
will ask you the ſame queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſecond intelligent being, and if
you fly to a third, you will get no more by it. Yet in the very inſtant when
we are pricked we feel pain. The ſuperior cauſe muſt then have learnt
that the Thorn pricks us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of other intelligent beings <hi>ad
infinitum.</hi> For as you ſee he would not have ſo ſoon an anſwer,
ſeeing 'tis no eaſie matter to find an ultimate in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. There
muſt be then an intelligent being that learns in himſelf and by its ſelf
in what moment the thorn pricks us: And this intelligent being can be no other
than God, that is to ſay, a being whoſe power is infinite, and whoſe will
alone is the cauſe of things. For after all, there is none but him whoſe
will is effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, that can ſee in himſelf and by himſelf the
exiſtence and the motion of Bodies. For it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould
be ignorant of his own will, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can diſcover within himſelf the
number, figure and ſcituation of bodies, and generally whatever happens to
them. It follows then that all other intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are enlightned by the
Creator. And as you ſee, or as you will clearly ſee if you think on it
ſeriouſly; you ſhould not know that you have a body, and that there are
others about you, if you had not learnt it <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42160:15"/>of him who knows
it by himſelf. Do you underſtand theſe things, <hi>Eraſtus?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do plainly, <hi>Theodorus.</hi> This is your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What
cauſes pain is neither the Soul that feels, nor the Thorn that pricks; but a
ſuperior power. This power ought at leaſt to know the moment when the thorn
pricks; he cannot know it from the thorn, ſeeing bodies cannot give any light
to ſpirits, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither viſible nor intelligible by themſelves,
and no relation being to be found between a body and a ſpirit. He can know it
then but by himſelf, that is to ſay, by the knowledge of his own will,
which creates and moves the thorn, and whoſe power is infinite, ſince it is
able to create. There is then a God; and if there was no God, I ſhould not be
pricked, I ſhould feel nothing, ſee nothing, and know nothing.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Think, I think that both you, and your echo <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>
talk in the clouds: The ground of your proof, is that that there is no relation
between bodies and ſpirits. From whence you conclude, that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel cannot
ſee a body immediately, and by himſelf. To which I anſwer, that that
ſpirits may know bodies, it is ſufficient that they penetrate them.</p>

               <p>How! You don't underſtand Anatomy: Muſt you ſearch in Books,
or in the head of other men which you do not penetrate, to know how the brain
which your ſoul penetrates is compos'd? What ſignifies it then to a
ſpirit to penetrate a body?</p>

               <p>I muſt confeſs I have nothing to anſwer. Yet methinks if a
ſpirit penetrates a body, he ought to know that body. But perhaps there is
ſomething that hinders it, which I do not underſtand.</p>

               <p>If it were ſo, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> this ſomething would be
the God whom we ſeek. I will loſe no time to prove it to you: For I will
not prove the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of God by imaginary effects. You may think on it at
your leiſure. But I rather adviſe you to make a ſerious reflection on the
things I have told you now, and then I hope you will viſibly find that there
is a God, I mean a Being whoſe Will is Power, and Power Infinite, ſince it
is able to create. You will find that this God doth not walk about the Heavens
as the Libertines will have it, but that his providence extends it ſelf to
all things, and that he acts inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly in us. That it is he that gives
us the pleaſing and painful ſentiments we have of ſenſible objects; and
that conſequently he may make us happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. In ſhort, you will
know God in the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner for morality. You will even confeſs
that God hath made nothing but may ſerve to demonſtrate his exiſtence,
though 'tis more conducing to morality, to demonſtrate it by ſomething that
paſſes within us.</p>
               <p>One of the reaſons why you are not eaſily brought to be of my
mind, is that you have perhaps never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly thought on the things of
which we have been <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42160:16"/>ſpeaking: For I do not perceive that
my proofs are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, or hard to be underſtood; I will be judg'd of it by
<hi>Eraſtus.</hi> And I believe we ought to agree on that point, that
hereafter you may be prepared on the ſubjects on which we ſhall treat.</p>

               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>It belongs to you, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> to ſet rules for every
thing. For you know that my reſolution is to ſeek none but ſuch truths as
are eſſential, and may make us wiſer, and more happy. I need ſay no
more to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>To this effect, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> I will tell you the
courſe I intend to keep in our Conferences: Obſerve it well, that you may
think on it at leiſure; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſelf to make me all the
Objections you can.</p>
               <p>I believe I have ſufficiently demonſtrated that there is a God
who acts inceſſantly in us, and who may make us happy or unhappy by
pleaſure and by pain, of which he alone is the true cauſe; and therefore I
will bring no other proofs of it, and will content my ſelf with reſolving
your difficulties. But I will prove to you that the deſign of God in creating
man, hath been that man might know and love him; that God hath preſerved man
but to that end: In ſhort, that that deſign is ſo unalterable, that
ſinners and the damned themſelves execute it in one ſenſe, and that
they ſhall ſooner ceaſe to be, than they ſhall wholly ceaſe to know
and to love God.</p>
               <p>When I have eſtabliſht as a principle, that ſince God acts
always for himſelf, we cannot be happy if we reſiſt his will, nor unhappy
if we obey it. I will demonſtrate how God will be known and be loved; how we
can reſiſt his orders; and what is yet more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42160:16"/>I will ſhow that our nature is corrupted,
that ſin dwells in us, that the ſpirit is a ſlave to the fleſh. In
ſhort, I will explain the cauſe and the effects of the corruption of
nature; how our diſorders ſtrange us from God and make us his enemies, as
alſo our want of a Mediator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>I will explain the qualities our Redeemer and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator ought to
have to reconcile us to God, and to ſatifie his juſtice; that Jeſus
Chriſt poſſeſſes them all, and none but him. What may cure the
blindneſs of the mind, and the malice of our heart: That thoſe remedies are
to be found in the precepts of the Goſpel, and the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.
In fine I will ſhow that none but a God made man can reſtore, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
and ſave us: That nothing but the blood of Chriſt can cleanſe us; that
nothing but his grace can ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us; that only his precepts can conduct
us to that wiſdom and to that felicity you wiſh for; and that all we have
to do in this life is to ſtudy the moral of the Goſpel, to hear Jeſus
Chriſt, to love Jeſus Chriſt, to follow and to imitate Jeſus Chriſt;
who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and
ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption; that according as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>he
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30,31.</p>

               <p>Nothing but truth can reconcile minds, and if you diſagree, it
is becauſe one of you doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult it. I am very much affraid that you
have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted your imagination more than your reaſon, and that you have
lancht into the deepeſt receſs of your memory for ſome juſtificative
evidence of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices. Tell me; is it not true, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi>
that you have but little meditated on the things I told you yeſterday; and
that whereas you ſhould have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them by the light of truth, you have
compar'd them with thoſe things of which the peruſual of the Ancients hath
left you a tincture? Will you never be <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42160:17"/>brought to, and will
you never underſtand that you have in your ſelf a faithful maſter ready
to give you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at all times, if you ask it with decency and
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; that is to ſay, in the calm of your ſenſes and

               <p>You tell me that you wanted me; but pray are you not aſhamed to

towards the light that enlightens me? Why are we ſometimes of the ſame

whom all mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the like anſwers? And why have you ſo much
diſputed with <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> but becauſe you told him things which the
truth he conſults did not tell him, nor had ever told you? I beg of you then,
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that we may have no more diſputes; but let truth be

               <p>Perhaps all the difficulty in the objections I made
<hi>Eraſtus</hi> proceeded from our ignorance of a great many things; and it
may be, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much uſed to meditate, I have propoſed to him my
ancient prejudices as ſo many new truths, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to
me by the ſtrength of meditation. But really I have ſtarted to him ſome
difficulties which ſeem to me grounded upon evident Principles, and are
received by all men: Here they are.</p>
               <p>You have told us that none but God can act in our ſoul, and that
all the bodies which are about us are <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42160:18"/>uncapable of
cauſing in us the ſentiments we have of them. But pray is not the Sun
bright enough to be viſible? Do you think I can ſuffer my ſelf to be
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, by Philoſophical Reaſons to believe, that 'tis not the Sun
that gives me light after all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments I have of it? And ſuppoſing
you could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me that Fire doth not cauſe the heat or pain I feel
when 'tis near me; Do you think you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Sun doth
notdiffuſe light, and ſay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as you do now, that all the bodies
that ſurround us, are uncapable of producing in us the ſentiments we have

intend to make it my buſineſs to explain to you all the difficulties of
Philoſophy which may puzzle you. The only thing that's neceſſary at
preſent is that you know there is a God, and he alone can cauſe in you the

               <p>I doubt of it for this Reaſon, that if God did cauſe in me the
pleaſure I feel in the uſe of ſenſible things. It ſeems he would
diſpoſe me to love them and to cleave to them as to my good: For pleaſure
is the character of good, 'tis an inſtinct of nature which diſpoſes us to
love what produces or ſeems to produce it. Yet faith teaches me that God will
not have me to love bodies. Can God draw me by pleaſure to cleave to
ſenſible things, and forbid me at the ſame <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42160:18"/>time to
love them? This is my difficulty, judge of it now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>It is a ſolid one, and 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to
ſolve it; for from its ſolution moſt of the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of morality
may be deduced. This is my ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">It is taken out of the fifth Chapter of
the firſt Book of the <hi>Inquiry after Truth.</hi> I have taken ſeveral
things from that Book, and deſire the Reader to take notice of it once for
all.</note>Being made up of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and body, we have two ſorts of good to
ſeek, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and corporal. We have likewiſe two ways to know if a
thing is good or bad, <hi>viz.</hi> the uſe of the mind alone, and the uſe
of the mind jointly with the body. We can know the good of the mind by an
evident and clear knowledge of the mind alone; and we can alſo diſcover the
good of the body by a confus'd ſentiment. By the mind I know juſtice is to
be beloved: and by the taſte I aſſure my ſelf ſuch a fruit is good.
The beauty of juſtice cannot fall under our ſenſes, for 'tis
unneceſſary to the perfection of the body; and the goodneſs of the fruit
doth not fall under our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for a fruit cannot be uſeful to the
perfection of the mind.</p>
               <p>The good of the body not deſerving the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind
which God made but for himſelf; and God not being willing that we ſhould be
taken up with it, it is neceſſary that the mind do know it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examination, and by the ſhort and inconteſtable proof of ſentiment. Bread
is fit to nouriſh us, and Stones are not: The proof of it is convincing, and
taſte alone hath made all mankind agree in that.</p>
               <p>If the mind ſaw in bodies but what is in them, without having a
ſentiment of what is not in them, <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42160:19"/>their uſe would be
very painful and inconvenient to us; for who would take the pains to examine
with care the nature of all things that are about us, to cleave to, or leave
them? What ſhould tell us when we ought to ſit down to dinner, and when
riſe from it? What ſhould place us at a reaſonable diſtance from the
fire? And ſhould we not often doubt whether we burnt or warm'd our ſelves?
In ſhort, would it not happen ſometimes that we ſhould be the cauſe of
our own death by Inadvertency, by Grief; or even out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of making
near diſcoveries in Anatomies.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is moſt reaſonable that God incline us to ſeek
the good of the body, and ſhun its contrary by the foregoing ſenſations
of Pleaſure, and Pain. For after all, if men were oblig'd to examine the
Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Fruit, thoſe of all the parts of their bodies, and the
different relations which reſult from the one to the other, to be able to
judge if in the preſent heat of their blood, and a thouſand other
diſpoſitions of their body, this Fruit were good to nouriſh them: 'tis
obvious that ſuch things as are altogether unworthy of the application of
their minds, would wholly fill its capacity; and that alſo unprofitably
enough, ſince they would not be able to preſerve themſelves any
conſiderable time by that only way.</p>

               <p>I muſt confeſs, this conduct is very wiſe, and moſt worthy

               <p>Becauſe they are not lovely, you are a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creature, and
your reaſon doth not repreſent to you bodies as your good. If ſenſible
objects did contain in themſelves what you feel, when you uſe them, if they
were the true cauſe of your Pleaſure and <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42160:19"/>Grief; you
might love and fear them; but your reaſon doth not tell you ſo, as I
yeſterday prov'd it to you. You may uſe them, but not love them; you may
eat of a fruit, but not ſettle your Love upon it: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you ought to
avoid Fire or a Sword, but ought not to fear them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See the 8th. Chapter of the 6th. Book
<hi>of the Inquiry after Truth.</hi>
                  </note>We muſt love and fear what is able
to cauſe pleaſure and pain, that's a common notion which I do not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict: But we muſt take heed not to confound the true efficient cauſe
with the occaſional. I ſay it once more, we muſt love and fear the
efficient cauſe of pleaſure and of pain, and we may ſeek or avoid their
occaſional cauſes, provided we do not do it againſt the poſitive orders
of that efficient cauſe, and do not force it in conſequence of its natural
Laws, to work in us what is againſt its precepts: And we muſt not imitate
the voluptuous, who make God an inſtument of their ſenſuality, and oblige
him, in conſequence of his firſt will, to reward them with a ſentiment of
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the very moment when they offend him; for that's the greateſt
Injuſtice can be committed.</p>
               <p>Believe me, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> the good of the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be belov'd but by Inſtinct; but the good of the mind can, and ought to be
belov'd by reaſon: The good of the body can be belov'd but by Inſtinct, and
with a blind Love; becauſe the mind cannot even perceive ſo clearly, that
the good of the body is a real good; for the mind cannot ſee what is not: It
cannot clearly perceive that Bodies are above the Spirit, that they can act in
it, puniſh, or reward it, and render it more happy, and more perfect; but the
good of the mind ought to be lov'd by reaſon; God will be lov'd 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42160:20"/>with a Love of choice, with a reaſonable Love, a
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Love, a Love worthy of him, and worthy of us; we ſee clearly
that God is our good, that he is above us, that he can act in us, that he can
reward us, and render us not only more happy, but alſo more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than we
are; is it not this ſufficient to make a Spirit love God?</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee, that God was not to make man love him, by the
inſtinct of Pleaſure when he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; he was not to make uſe of this
kind of art, nor implore any force againſt the Liberty of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creature, to leſſen the merit of his Love: For the firſt man ought to
have adhered to God, and could do it without the help of a preingaging
pleaſure, though now Pleaſure is commonly neceſſary to remedy the
blindneſs which ſin has brought upon us, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the continual
attacks of Concupiſcence againſt our Reaſon.</p>
               <p>I'le ſay it again, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that you may
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it. It was neceſſary that the antecedent pleaſure and not the
light of reaſon, ſhould incline us to the good of the body; ſince
reaſon cannot even repreſent to its ſelf the bodies that are about us, as
a good. But there was no need that God ſhould make uſe of prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
pleaſure, as of a kind of art to cauſe himſelf to be beloved by the
firſt man; ſince it was ſufficient that he ſhould enlighten his
reaſon, he being the ſole and only good of Spirits.</p>

               <p>I grant all theſe things are very well imagin'd, but there is
ſtill in your Syſtem a difficulty that puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles me: For methinks you
confound Concupiſcence with the inſtitution of Nature, and making God the
Author of the pleaſure we feel in the uſe of ſenſible things, you
alſo make him Author of Concupiſcence, <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42160:20"/>ſince it is
nothing elſe but that pleaſure, conſidered as ſtriving againſt our

               <p>This inſtitution of Nature is thus, <hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath made the Soul and the Body of man, and 'twas his
pleaſure, for the preſervation of his work, that as often as there ſhould
be in the body ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain motions, there ſhould reſult in the Soul
ſome certain ſentiments; provided thoſe motions did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
themſelves as far as a certain part of the Brain, which I ſhall not
ſpecifie, but becauſe the will of God is efficacious, there never hapned
any motions in that part of the Brain, but there followed ſome
ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and becauſe the will of God is unchangeable, this was not
changed by the ſin of the firſt man: Yet as before man had ſinned, and
whilſt all things were in perfect good order, it was not juſt that the body
ſhould hinder the Spirit from thinking on what is deſired; It follows that
man had neceſſarily ſuch a power over his body that he did, as it were,
ſeparate the principal part of his brain from the reſt of his body, and did
hinder its uſual communication with the ſenſitive Nerves, as often as he
deſired to apply himſelf to truth, or to ſome other thing than the good
of the body. And by thoſe means it was in <hi>Adam</hi>'s power firſt to
make uſe of his taſte to diſcern the things that were uſeful to the
preſervation of the body, and then to eat on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taſte and pleaſure;
becauſe the pleaſure be felt in the uſe of ſenſible things never
overruled his deſires; it only modeſtly warn'd of what he was to do for the
good of his body: <hi>Adam</hi> therefore could think on what he would; and one
may ſay, that even when he ſlept his Spirit was awake: For after all it
cannot be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that in the ſtate of Original Righteouſneſs, there

               <p>The firſt man, by degrees ſtranging himſelf from from the
preſence of God, by ſuffering the capacity of his Spirit to be fill'd with
ſenſible pleaſures, or the ſentiments of his own excellency, or with
ſome other Ideas which, by reaſon of the narrowneſs of his Spirit, did
blot out the remembrance of his Duty and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; fell at laſt into a

               <p>All this is very well; but why doth God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be willing
that the impreſſions of the brain, and the agitations of the animal
ſpirits ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſentiments and ſenſible motions;
ſince that hinders us now from loving him, and applying our ſelves to the
Truth for which we are made.</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But why, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> will you have the will of God to
depend from that of the firſt man? You <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42160:22"/>have ſeen that
the inſtitution of Nature is admirably well ordered; and would you have this
Inſtitution al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, on the account of the mutability of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
will? Do you not know that the inconſtancy of the will is a mark of a narrow
Underſtanding, and that God is too juſt to repent. All what God has will'd,
he wills it ſtill; and becauſe his will is efficacious he doth it. God had
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome time be ſubſervient to the injuſtice of men, and even
in one ſenſe to reward them, by the pleaſure they feel in their
Debaucheries, than to alter the order of things which he hath moſt wiſely
eſtabliſht. And men are ſo unworthy of God, after the rebellion of their
firſt Father, that 'tis juſt in one ſenſe, that God remove them from
him continually, and in a manner reward them when they go from him; but it is a
tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory reward, a deceitful reward, the price of ſin, that fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the
Victim for the Sacrifice, and prepares ſinners for the day of the Lord; for
that day when the Judge and Saviour of the world will hurry the impious in the
fire everlaſting to ſatisfie the divine juſtice; as he will raiſe with
him the elect to an Eternal Glory, to exalt the Goodneſs and Mercy of his
Father.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> the Will of God which forms and
rules ſo wiſely all things, was not to depend from that of the firſt man.
It was neceſſary that this will ſhould ſubſiſt, and that he whoſe
wiſdom has no bounds ſhould re-eſtabliſh, in a manner worthy of
himſelf, the order of things which Free-will had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. He hath done
it, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> by his

               <p>Give me leave, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> to offer to you the greateſt
difficulty I find in all the things you have told us now. God is infinitely
wiſe, he hath foreſeen from all Eternity whatever was to fall out in the
order of things he was to eſtabliſh; he hath foreſeen the ſin of the
firſt man, before he was form'd; why then did he make him? Or why did he make
him free, or why did he not bind and faſten him to his duty by preingaging
Pleaſures? In ſhort, why did he eſtabliſh an order that was to be
overthrown, and a Nature that was to grow corrupt? I grant that he hath
repaired the corruption of Nature by the wiſeſt method imaginable, but
would it not have been wiſer to have made one uncapable of Corruption? I beg
of you to tell me if theſe things may not juſtly make us doubt, whither an
infinite intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent being rules all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But ſuppoſing I did not give you an anſwer
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> what could you directly infer from my ſilence, but that I
do not know the deſigns of God? I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently demonſtrated to you, by
arguing only upon clear Ideas, that there is a God, and that none but him acts
really in us. Believe what you have ſeen, and do not wilfully blind your
ſelf by oppoſing to the light of truth, ſome objections which can riſe
but from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our minds: When we ſee evidently a thing we
muſt not ceaſe to believe it, as ſoon as ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty we cannot
ſolve is offer'd to us.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> though I do not flatter my
ſelf to know God's deſigns, I'le endeavour to ſatisfie you in few words,
for I will not engage my ſelf to ſay to you, whatever may be thought upon
that ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42160:23"/>God made man becauſe it was his will, and it
was his will becauſe man is better than nothing, and that he is more capable
of honouring him than nothing.</p>
               <p>God made man free, becauſe the will of man is made to love good;
but man being able to love but what he ſees, if God had not made him free, or
if God did infallibly and neceſſarily carry him towards all that hath the
appearance of a good, or towards all that man being apt to err, may conſider
as a good; it might be ſaid that God is the cauſe of ſin, and of the
diſorderly motions of the will.</p>
               <p>God made man free, and left him to himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determining
him by preingaging pleaſure, becauſe God will be loved by reaſon, ſince
we are rational Creatures: He will be lov'd with an Underſtanding Love, with
a Love worthy of him, and worthy of us; a meritorious Love, and which he may
remunerate, for other reaſons which I have already told you. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
that man would ceaſe to love him, I grant it, but he draws his glory from
thence. The ſhame of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will adds to Gods honour every way, and man being
not able to truſt to his own ſtrength, finds himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd by
Juſtice, to give to God all the Glory of his actions.</p>
               <p>But how do you know after all, but that the firſt and the chief
deſign of God in the Creation of man, was the Incarnation of his Son; it may
be, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that the order of Nature is only the occaſional
cauſe of that of Grace, and that God would not have made man, if the fall of
man had not given lew to his reparation. I grant that if man had not ſinn'd
the Word had not been made fleſh: But is it not certain that the Obedience
and Sacrifice of the incarnate Word, hath pleaſed him more who orders all
things according to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42160:24"/>than the rebellion
of man hath diſpleas'd him? Is it not reaſonable to believe that God hath
done all for his Son, ſince he hath made all by his Son, and that his chief
intent in the diſpoſition of his work, hath been to eſtabliſh his Son
Chief of his Church, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord over all his creatures. <hi>O
certè neceſſarium Adae peccatum—O felix culpa quae talem ac
tantum meruit habere Redemptorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take notice of this, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> God acts for his glory;
and the chief of his deſigns is that by which he gets moſt of it: But doth
he not receive more glory from his Son than from all the reſt of his works?
He hath in his Son an Adorer, a Sacrificator, and a Victim of an infinite
dignity, for his Son is a God that worſhips him, a God that obey's him, a God
that dyes to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Holineſs and Juſtice. But ſuppoſing even no
bounds to the world, what honour would accrue by it to its Author? Suppoſing
all creatures were inceſſantly imployed to praiſe him who gave them
being; what proportion is there between the creature and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, between
the praiſes of the bleſſed Spirits and the infinite greatneſs of God;
except it be that the praiſes of the Saints receive a kind of an infinite
greatneſs and dignity in Jeſus Chriſt, through whom, as the Church
ſings, Angels praiſe the Divine Majeſty, Powers adore him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Church knows very well that 'tis only through Jeſus
Chriſt we can render to God an honour worthy of him.</p>
               <p>I will explain to you thoſe things more at large at ſome other
time. What I have ſaid now is ſufficient, to let you judge that though God
did foreſee the fall of man, he was not to change his deſign; ſince that
fall hath been the occaſion of that great work ſo worthy the greatneſs,
and mercy of God, and ſo admirable all manner of ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42160:24"/>Yet though what I have told you were not
certain, you ought not to believe eaſily that God ought to have alter'd his
deſign becauſe he foreſaw the ſin of the firſt man, and the
diſorder of Nature. Can you think, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that if god only
deſign'd to make a man he would make a Monſter? I mean that he would make
him with two heads, one of which would be uſeleſs, and only troubleſome
to him, or make him with an uſeleſs Arm ſprouting our of his forehead,
and dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling continually over his face? Can you imagin that ſuch a Creature
would be a work worthy of an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence infinitely wiſe and powerful? Yet
there are Monſters, and I do not believe that thoſe ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of
Nature ought to leſſen the eſteem you have of its Author; not only
becauſe thoſe Monſters, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imperfect in themſelves, do not make
the world imperfect: But chiefly becauſe thoſe monſters are the
conſequences of the communication which is between the imagination of the
Mother, and the fruit ſhe bears in her Womb, and that this communication is
very wiſely eſtabliſht for the formation or increaſing of the
Child.</p>
               <p>God did well foreſee that this communication would ſometimes
cauſe ſome diſorder, but ſeeing it would be of an infinitely greater
uſe towards the, accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his work, than this ſmall diſorder,
he ought not to have alter'd his deſing. 'Tis true that God could have
remedied it, by eſtabliſhing for theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes ſome new
Laws of motion: But God doth not multiply his will thus, it is a point of his
greatneſs and his wiſdom to act always by the moſt ſimple ways, and to
make uſe of a very ſmall number of Natural Laws to produce a very great
number of admirable works.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42160:25"/>Neither do I believe, that we ought always to
imagin that God hath other ways to produce his work, as ſimple and perfect as
thoſe of whom he hath made uſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he could make it more perfect than
it is, and ſuch as we would have it to be; for this perhaps may not be. 'Tis
likely that God acts in the manner the moſt worthy of him that may be, I mean
that his work is as perfect as it can be by relation to the methods which he
uſes to produce it: and if we imagin that we diſcover ſome faults in it,
beſides our natural diſpoſition to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſtaken, it may
proceed from the ſimplicity of the means of which he hath made uſe to form
this work, and from the union which all bodies have with one another. Could you
imagin <hi>Eraſtus</hi> that God, though all wiſe and all mighty, cannot
fill intirely with ſmall round balls the leaſt ſpace that we can
determine? Yet if you think on it ſeriouſly you will eaſily find that
this cannot be done; and that the balls touching one another, and leavinga
triangular ſpace, there muſt be ſomething beſides balls to fill it. But
from whence proceeds this impoſſibility? 'tis not from any want of
wiſdom, nor power in the cauſe; but from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which bodies have
with one another. There is ſuch a Concatenation in all the parts which make
up the world, that we have ſome reaſon to believe that perhaps it impylteh
contradiction that man ſhould be more perfect than he is, by relation to the
bodies that ſurround him, and that perhaps it is not poſſible for him to
have wings, and be at the ſame time as well compoſed as he is by relation
to the wants of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life.</p>
               <p>And thus, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> as you muſt not think that God
ought to have abandon'd his deſign of forming men by the uſual way of
generation, becauſe men ſeem to be <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42160:25"/>imperfect, and
monſters are ſometimes generated that way: So you ought not to imagin that
God foreſeeing the ſin of man, ought to have taken another deſign; tho he
had not even repair'd the diſorder of nature, by a way as worthy of his
wiſdom as is the incarnation of his Son.</p>

               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that what you ſay is very
reaſonable, and that thoſe want both ſtrength and firmneſs of judgment
who abandon evident truths, when ſome difficulties which they cannot ſolve
are offer'd to them, tho' thoſe difficulties have no other ground than the
ignorance and weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mind. And this perſuades me that moſt
of thoſe whom the world call men of great ſenſe, ſuch as are ſome
that were here ſome days ago, have not ſo much ſtrength of
underſtanding as <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> imagins.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You are not miſtaken, <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> thoſe men of mighty
ſenſe are commonly diminutive Wits, who have more pride than knowledge;
their underſtanding being but ſmall, they neither imbrace nor retain
eaſily the proofs of even the moſt common truths, and yet their pride makes
them decide ſome queſtions which 'tis abſolutely impoſſible to
ſolve. Take heed that you never be frighted as they are by the little
difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they raiſe to themſelves againſt the exiſtence of
God and the immortality of the Soul, and that you never ſuffer your ſelf to
be ſtunn'd by the outward method of their raſh deciſions. Hearken to
Reaſon, and follow its light, but never yield to the ſenſible attempt
which the imagination of others makes upon your mind. Do you underſtand me
well <hi>Eraſtus?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Very well: You would not have me think, or live by opinion, but
think and live by reaſon; and <pb n="40" facs="tcp:42160:26"/>ſhun carefully the
contagion of minds, which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates it ſelf by the ways and manners of
thoſe who ſpeak to us. I endeavour it as much as I can, and am not afraid
that any of our pretended men of mighty ſenſe, will ſhake me by whatever
they can ſay againſt the proofs of the exiſtence of God, which you have
explain'd to us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>And you, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> are you fully convinc'd that
there is a cauſe ſuperiour to you, infinitely wiſe and powerful? have you
any more reaſonable doubts to propoſe to me? I am ſenſible that you are
not yet freed from the Pannick fear, which your Heroes have inſpir'd in you,
and that you are always mov'd by ſome Ideas, and confus'd ſentiments that
will diſturb your imagination a long time, to juſtifie the reaſonings of
your pretended men of ſenſe: But is your reaſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd? Is the
light that ſpreads it ſelf in it, according as you give attention to my
words, a pure light that perſuades by evidence? Hath it not ſome dazzling
and glittering luſtre which convinces you by impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For as I am

ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, I was not oblig'd to eſtabliſh their certitude, but only to
ſhow their poſſibility. It may be I will convince you of them hereafter.
Nevertheleſs if you are well perſuaded of their poſſibility, you ought

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You convert him, <hi>Ariſtarchus!</hi> I wiſh it. But do you
think that God ſpeaks to him as he doth to you? Or rather do you think he
retires like you within himſelf to hear him? He hath ſtopp'd his Ears ſo
long that he is become Deaf. You will ſpeak to his Ears, but you will not
ſpeak to his mind. Do you <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42160:27"/>not know that he is held by too
many things, and that his paſſions whoſe motions he blindly follows, have
made him ſlave to whatever is about him? Doth not his Court air, his deſire
of being eſteemed a wit his inſolent and ſlighting way of diſcourſing
about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters, ſufficiently ſhow you that he inceſſantly
receives the ſecret inſpirations of the Spirit of Pride? While you will be
ſpeaking to him, he will laugh at your ſimplicity, he will dazzle you by a
language of imagination, and you will ſee your ſelf ſhamefully thrown at
his feet; and truth unworthily us'd by that ſmall ſociety of his admirers
who applaud him in whatever he ſaith.</p>
               <p>If you are reſolv'd to attempt his Converſion, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you
to take him by himſelf, to ſpeak to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being daunted, to put
queſtions to him continually as having need of his light, and to make him
retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf by inſenſible degrees, that he may hearken to
truth without being interrupted by his paſſions. When we deſign to
convince men, we muſt always ſee their Self-love, and inſtruct them by
ſuch a method as may make them imagine that they ſchool us. We muſt take
the air of Diſciples, and ask them queſtions with art and an ingenious
plainneſs, that taking a pleaſure to inſtruct us they may retire within
themſelves to receive the anſwers that we ask them; but when we have
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from them the anſwers they have ſtrove to find out for us, we
muſt lay them before them every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for having only ſought thoſe
anſwers for us, they think no more on them, as ſoon as they have eas'd
themſelves of them.</p>
               <p>Truth is a very unneceſſary lumber to moſt men; it is only
cumberſome to them. But when 'tis of their own finding out, and that by this
title it belongs <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42160:27"/>to them, ſelf-love ſuffers it
willingly; and they find in it I know not what charm, that wins them in
ſpight of the inconveniency they receive by it. So when you ſhall have
received a good anſwer to ſome one of the ſeveral queſtions you had
ask'd your friend, you may make uſe of it to convince him, he will not
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it, except you vex him; and it may be that his ſelf-love happily
betraying his ſleeping paſſions, he will rejoyce at the ſight of a
truth he could not bear a little while before.</p>

infinitely perfect, whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power have no bounds, and whoſe

that we know and love him. Since then this ſeems to be plain to you, how can
it happen that there be men that neither know nor love God, ſince God
preſerves them but to know and love him? Do you think it poſſible to
reſiſt God, and that God hath any love for Spirits who have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

judge that thoſe material Stars are like thoſe of the intelligible world I
ſee. For the Sun that I ſee, is ſometimes bigger and ſometimes leſs,
and is never bigger than an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Circle of two or three foot diameter;

               <p>I am afraid that <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> will ſay I am full of

               <p>There is a difference between ſeeing the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God,
and ſeeing the eſſence of things in God. For though we ſee nothing but
God when we ſee the eſſence of things in God, we ſee God but by
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Creatures, we ſee the perfections of God but as they repreſent
another thing than God. So that though we ſee God, and can ſee nothing but
him, ſince he preſerves ſpirits for himſelf only, it may in one
ſenſe be ſaid that we ſee nothing but the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For tho God
ſees nothing but himſelf, 'tis certain that he ſees the Creatures when he
ſees what is in himſelf that repreſents them: Thus though we ſee God
but by an immediate and direct ſight we ſee in God that which repreſents
them, for the Creatures are inviſible in themſelves.</p>

nor ſpiritual Creature can act immediately in the ſoul, and cauſe it
ſelf to be ſeen by it. God ſhows us whatever we ſee, but 'tis in his
ſubſtance that he ſhows it us; for the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alone can give
us life, enlighten and make us happy. We are made to be nouriſhed with that
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and to live by it; and if the ſpirit hath ſome life, I mean
if it hath ſome knowledge (for the <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42160:30"/>knowledge of truth is
the life of the ſoul, it receives it from, and in that ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Whatever God hath done, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> he hath done it after
his Image, or according to his Image; he hath made the Animals, Plants, and
even the Inſects according to the Image, or living <hi>Idea</hi> he hath of
them. For he hath made all things by his Son, by his Word, according to the
uncreated Wiſdom, in which all things live. But he hath not only made man
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Image or Wiſdom; but alſo for his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to
contemplate the Eternal Wiſdom that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Ideas of all things.</p>
               <p>An Impertinent Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Averrois.</note>
found this fault in the Religion of Chriſtians, that they Eat him whom they
adore, condemning our Communion with the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,
whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive after we have Worſhipped him. 
<note n="*" place="margin">Pontificius Loquitur.</note>He did not
know that the Wiſdom of the Father, the Word that enlightens and nouriſhes
our Spirit, deſired to teach us in a ſenſible manner, and by the real
Manducation of his Body, that he is really our Life and Nouriſhment, and that
he hath made our Spirit to know and to love him: For our Spirit ought to love,
but what gives it Life, nouriſhes, makes it more perfect, and is above it,
ſince only this can be his true good.</p>
               <p>If it is certain that our thinking faculty comes from God, 'tis
certain that it is made for God, ſince God Acts only for himſelf, as
<hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> owns. But if we do not ſee things in God, how can it
be ſaid that God hath only made, and doth only preſerve us for himſelf;
for after all, if Bodies are the immediate object of our Knowledge, our Spirit
is partly made to ſee them: In what ſenſe can it alſo be ſaid that
God <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42160:31"/>preſerves the ſpirits of Devils and the Damned but
for himſelf, if the ſpirit of thoſe wretches doth not ſee God in ſome
manner? You will tell me they are Dead; and that is true in ſome ſenſe,
but they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps know ſome truth, and if the knowledge of truth is the life
of the Soul, they are not intirely dead, nor annihilated, they have yet ſome
union with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom, whoſe light penetrates into the very
abyſs. They nouriſh themſelves with the word if they have ſome life
left, becauſe he alone is life; but they are not the happier for it, for they
wiſh themſelves dead. They nouriſh themſelves with a truth they do not
relliſh; they ſeek darkneſs, and annihilation; and wiſh that this
remainder of union with God that enlightens and preſerves them, maybreak and
diſſolve it ſelf for ever.</p>

               <p>What do you tell us here; <hi>Theodore:</hi> Doth the ſpirit
ſee nothing but God? What! Do we ſee Errour in God? Do the Philoſophers
ſee all their Chymera's in God? And doth the Father of lies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from
God—.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Errour cannot be ſeen <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> 'Tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
viſible nor intelligible. Truth, is a relation that is; And what is, may be
ſeen. There is a relation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality between two times two and four, and
this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may be ſeen becauſe it is. There is a relation of inequality
between two times two and five, and this relation of inequality may be ſeen
becauſe it is. So truth is viſible or intelligible; but errour is not. One
cannot ſee that two times two is five, or a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of equality between two
times two and five, for there is no ſuch relation of equality. One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee that two times two is not four, nor a relation of inequality between two
times two and four, for <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42160:31"/>there is no ſuch relation of
inequality. And thus when men miſtake themſelves, they do not ſee the
relations which they ſuppoſe they ſee. When a man miſtakes himſelf,
he may well ſee things in God, though after an imperfect manner, but he doth
not ſee the relations that are between things; for thoſe things are, and
thoſe relations are not. I will not here explain the cauſe of our errour,
and our different ways of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it. It hath been done already.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I own, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that we ſee in God the eternal truths
and immutable laws of Morality. A finite and changeable ſpirit cannot ſee
in himſelf the eternity of thoſe truths, nor the immutability of thoſe
laws, 'tis in God, he ſees them. But he cannot ſee in God tranſitory
truths and corruptible things, ſince there is nothing in God but what is
Immutable and Incorruptible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Yet, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> God ſees all the changes that happen in
the world, and 'tis in himſelf only he ſees them: It follows then that he
ſees in himſelf what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſubject to change or corruption, though
there is nothing in him but is perfectly Immutable and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible. But all
this may be explained thus.</p>
               <p>God hath in himſelf the Idea (for example) of Extent, ſince he
ſees it, and hath made it; and this Idea in Incorruptible. 'Twas his will
there ſhould be extended beings, and thoſe beings were produced. 'Twas
alſo his will that thoſe extended parts ſhould be inceſſantly moved,
and communicate naturally their motions to one another. Now this communication
of motions which cannot be unknown to God, it being impoſſible he ſhould
not know his will that cauſes it, is the principle of the mutability,
corruption, and generation of all different bodies. Thus God ſees 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42160:32"/> 
                  <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

                  </gap> 
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42160:33"/>in himſelf the corruption of all things, though he is
incorruptible, for whilſt he ſees in his wiſdom the incorruptible Ideas,
he ſees in his will all corruptible things; ſince nothing happens but is
done by him.</p>
               <p>Now I will tell you how we ſee all thoſe things in God. All
ideas and immutable truths we ſee in him. As for tranſitory truths, we do
not know them in the will of God, as God himſelf doth, for his will is
unknown to us: But we know them by the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God cauſes in us at their
preſence. Thus when I ſee the Sun I ſee the Idea of a circle in God, and
have in my ſelf the ſentiment of light which denotes to me that this Idea
repreſents ſomething that is created, and actually extent: But I have this
ſentiment from none but God who certainly can cauſe it in me, ſince he is
Almighty, and ſees in the Idea he hath of my Soul, that I am capable of
ſentiment.</p>
               <p>Thus in all our ſenſible knowledge of corruptible things,
there is pure Idea, and ſentiment; the Idea is in God, the Sentiment in us,
but God alone is the true Cauſe of both. The Idea repreſents the
Eſſence of the thing, and the ſentiment only makes us believe that it
exiſts, ſince it diſpoſes us to believe that the thing cauſes it in
us, becauſe it is then preſent to our mind, and not the will of God, which
alone cauſes that ſentiment in us.</p>

               <p>I own that God can enlighten us, and ſhow us in himſelf all
the Ideas we have of things. But why ſhould you have your recourſe to this
laſt refuge? At leaſt explode the ſentiments of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers upon that

<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> But if your friend finds
fault with me for having a recourſe to God and the firſt cauſe, to
explain ſome certain things, you may tell him that there are two kinds of
natural effects: The Particular, and the General: it is ridiculous to have
recourſe to the general cauſe to explain particular effects; but 'tis as
much amiſs to ſeek ſome particular cauſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the general.</p>
               <p>For example, if I am asked why Linnen becomes dry when 'tis
expoſed to fire: I will not anſwer like a Philoſopher, if I ſay that
God will have it ſo; for 'tis ſufficiently known that whatever happens, is
by his will. 'Tis not the general cauſe is demanded, but the particular
cauſe of a particular effect. I ought then to ſay that the ſmall
particles of the fire, or the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wood ſtriking againſt the linnen
impart their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the particles of water that are in it, and looſen
them from the linnen; and I ſhall have given the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſe of the
particular effect. But if one ask'd me, why the particles of the wood agitate
thoſe of the water, or why bodies communicate their motion to thoſe they
meet: I ſhould not be a Philoſopher, did I ſeek ſome particular cauſe
of that general effect; I ought to have recourſe to the general cauſe, that
is to the Will of God, and not to ſome particular faculties or qualities.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis acknowledged that the effect is general, and that
conſequently we muſt have recourſe to the general cauſe, when theſame
effect hath no neceſſary connexion with what ſeems to be its cauſe, as
it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the communication of motion; for the mind ſees no
neceſſity why a body, that preſſes upon another, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42160:34"/>ſhould puſh it forwards rather then recoil it ſelf: If then your
friend pretends to explain to you the nature and original of Ideas by the
ſcientific terms of <hi>innate</hi> or <hi>viſible ſpecies</hi> of
<hi>external</hi> or <hi>internal ſenſes,</hi> of <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
apprehenſions</hi> of <hi>the active</hi> or <hi>paſſible intellect,</hi>
you may let him know that when a body changes its ſituation or figure, there
is no neceſſity that there be a new thought in a ſpirit; And that
therefore we muſt go to the general cauſe which alone can reconcile things
that have no neceſſary relation with one another. I will loſe no time in
ſolving all the difficulties you or your friend may find concerning what I
have told you now. You will perhaps find them ſolv'd in the third book <hi>of
the Inquiry after Truth.</hi> Let us come to the will of man. I will explain it
to you.</p>
               <p>God only making and preſerving us for himſelf, inceſſantly
moves us towards him, that is to ſay towards good in general, or towards what
we conceive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all good. He even moves us towards particular good
without removing us from himſelf; becauſe he includes that good in the
infinity of his being: For as ſpirits ſee none but him, in the ſenſe
that I have explained, he may incline us towards whatever we ſee, though he
hath made us for himſelf alone. But we ought to obſerve that he inclines us
invincibly and neceſſarily towards good in general, becauſe as the love
of good in general can never be bad, it was not to be free: But as the love of
particular good, though good in it ſelf, may be bad, it was to be in our
power to conſent to or withſtand its motion.</p>

               <p>But how can the love of particular good be bad,
<hi>Theodorus?</hi> We only love what we ſee, we ſee nothing but God,
therefore we love nothing but God when it ſeems we love the Creatures; how
then can our love be bad?</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>We love nothing but God, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> for God
preſerves us only to love him: But our love is bad when it is not regulated:
Or rather our love is always good abſolutely and in it ſelf, but it is not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively good. Our love is always good in it ſelf, for we can never love
what ſeems bad to us: We can love but what we believe to be good and lovely,
ſince 'tis God that makes us love, and that we love none but him, becauſe
we love nothing but what we ſee in him. But our love is bad relatively,
becauſe we love too much thoſe things that are leaſt lovely; in ſhort,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inſtead of loving God in himſelf, we love him with relation to
his Works, for loving only what we ſee, we love God, but only as he
repreſents a vile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not according to what he is in
himſelf.</p>
               <p>God allows us to love what is in him that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a
creature, for that is good; but he will not have us to fix there the motion of
our love: He would have us to love whatever he includes. He would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
according to the Idea of Being in general, of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely perfect, and
ſoveraignly lovely; which Idea hath no relation but to himſelf, and
repreſents nothing that is out of him. Nothing but the Idea of the infinite
good ought to ſtop the motion of our love; and we are ſo free in the love
of finite good that we even feel the ſecret reproaches of our reaſon, when
we fix our ſelves on it: Becauſe he that made us for himſelf ſpeaks to
us, that we may turn to him, and give no bounds to the motion of love which he
inceſſantly produces in us. All the motion that the ſoul hath towards
good, comes from God, and God only acting for himſelf, all the motion of the
ſoul hath no other end nor bound than God in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature.
God preſenting to ſpirits no other <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42160:35"/>Idea but himſelf,
ſince he hath made ſpirits for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; All the motion of our wills is
towards him, ſince wills move themſelves towards thoſe things only which
the ſpirit perceives. But men thinking that they ſee creatures in
themſelves, the conſent they give to the motion that God imprints in them,
ends in the creatures; and it may be ſaid with a great deal of truth that the
free will of men, or their conſent to the motion they receive from God, tends
to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though the natural motion of their love can tend only to
God.</p>
               <p>By this you ſee <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that God preſerves
ſpirits for himſelf only; that the faculties they enjoy, to know and love,
know and love none but him; that ſinners do not overturn the laws of nature;
that they are inviolable; and that this general principle of Religion and
Morality, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath made us for himſelf, is undeniable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But if the order of nature is that we know and love God; and if we
cannot reſiſt that order, ſince the motion of our love for the creatures
tends of neceſſity towards the Creator; how can it be ſaid that we really
offend God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>It may be ſaid for many reaſons.</p>
               <p>God inceſſantly moves ſpirits towards good either general or
particular; for all good is to be beloved. He invincibly moves them towards
general good, but 'tis otherwiſe with the impreſſion he gives them
towards particular good. God doth not limit towards that good the act which he
produces in them: For if we obſerve it duely, we ſufficiently perceive that
in the very time when we fix on ſome finite good, we have ſome motion to go
further if we will. So we offend God by ſtopping his act, and not letting him
act in us according to the full extent of his act.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:42160:35"/>The reaſon why God moves us towards good is
becauſe it moves us towards him; and he moves us towards himſelf becauſe
he loves himſelf. 'Tis then the love of God to himſelf that produces our
love in us, Therefore our love ought to be like to that which God bears to
himſelf: But it is not like it when it concenters in a particular good; it is
then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the cauſe that hath produced it, and it may be ſaid to be
diſpleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>Order is certainly the eſſential and neceſſary Will of
God, according to which, and by which he wills whatever he wills, for God loves
order, he wills no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but order, his will always follows order: But a
creature who loves more thoſe things that are leſs lovely, thwarts order,
withdraws himſelf from it, and even overthrows it as much as he is capable of
it. He reſiſts then to the will of God, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to come into
the order of his juſtice, ſince he leaves that of his goodneſs which is
the firſt and moſt natural.</p>
               <p>God alone can act in the ſoul and cauſe in her ſome
pleaſure: And by his decree or general will that makes the order of nature,
'twas his deſire that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould attend certain motions in the
body. So thoſe that produce in their body theſe motions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon
&amp; even againſt the ſecret reproaches of their reaſon, oblige God in
conſequence of his general will to renumerate them by pleaſing
ſentiments, even in the very time when they ought to be puniſhed. They
therefore uſe violence againſt his juſtice, and offend him. But they only
uſe this violence, by the love they have for particular good: So this love
offends God. For all thoſe who love their pleaſure, without minding the
true cauſe that produces it, offend <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42160:36"/>that cauſe: ſince
God never cauſes pleaſure with an intent that we ſhould fix on it; but
rather that we may love the cauſe that produces the pleaſure, and that we
may unite with the thing that determines that cauſe to produce it.</p>
               <p>You ſee therefore, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that God is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when we fix the motion of love he cauſes in us, on particular good. But
though you might not ſee it, you cannot doubt but it is ſo; for when we
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our love to ſome particular good, we feel an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward check in the
ſecret of our reaſon, and a juſt check is a mark of infidelity againſt
him that cauſes it, thoſe checks or reproaches can proceed but from a
general cauſe, ſince they are generally to be found in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and
muſt therefore be juſt, ſince they are cauſed by a juſt God; and this
juſt God is offended when we confine our love to particular good. This
ſingle Argument is ſufficient, for 'tis unneceſſary to ſeek
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical proofs of a thing whereof we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inward
ſentiments, that is, by a light which ſtrikes through the blindeſt, and
by a puniſhment that ſtings the moſt hardened ſinners.</p>

               <p>If you believe all this, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you may ſee
your friend, ask him at firſt if he deſires to be happy. Show him that none
but God can act, and cauſe in him that pleaſure he loves ſo much, and
that renders him the more happy the greater it is: Let him know that God is
juſt, that he will be obey'd, that it cannot be conceived he ſhould make
truely happy thoſe who do not follow his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor unhappy thoſe that
follow them; that ſo we ought to uſe all our endeavours to know the Will of
God, and ought to obey it with all the fidelity ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42160:36"/>You are ſenſible that men muſt be either ſtupid or
out of their ſenſes, not to ſee thoſe things, and that thoſe that
ſee them and are not affected with them muſt either be mad or deſperate;
but do not tell him ſo; take heed above all things you do not awaken his
paſſions, and principally his pride; for he would conceive nothing of what
you might tell him; make him underſtand as much as you can, that God acts
only for himſelf; That he hath made our ſpirit only for himſelf; That he
hath given ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our heart, only to incline it towards him; That
therefore we ought not to make an ill uſe of the motion of love which God
cauſes in us, by loving any thing beſides him, or without relation to
him.</p>
               <p>Make him underſtand that God is his true good, not only by being
alone capable to make him happy, but alſo becauſe none but God can make him
more perfect; not only as he is the cauſe of pleaſure, but alſo as he is
the original of light.</p>
               <p>Endeavour to perſuade him that God alone is the life and
nouriſhment of the ſoul; That all bodies are inviſible by themſelves,
and altogether uncapable of producing any ſentiment in our ſouls; That all
good is included in God in an intelligible manner, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fit to act into
the mind, to ſhew it ſelf, and cauſe it ſelf to be felt by it; In
ſhort, that God alone is the true good of the mind all manner of ways, and
that we ought to love and adore none but him.</p>
               <p>Raiſe in him a deſire to hear you, by things on which perhaps
he never thought, and ſuch as may by their novelty ſtir up in him a
ſalutary curioſity. But above all things, endeavour to make him very
ſenſible of his unjuſtice towards God, whilſt he follows his
paſſions: And that being a ſinner, and conſequently <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42160:37"/>unworthy of being rewarded by the delightful ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
pleaſure, he obliges God in conſequence of his immutable orders to affect
him with delight in the very moment he offends him: Death ſhall corrupt his
body, and then God remaining unchangeable in his decrees, will avenge during a
whole eternity the wrongs he ſhall have done him, by compelling him, in a
manner not only to be ſubſervient to his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but even to reward
him for his diſobedience.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, make him ſenſible of the neceſſity there is to
repent, and ſtrive to inſpire in him a ſaultary horror of all thoſe
criminal pleaſures that bewitch the ſenſes, and corrupt the heart and
reaſon: That retiring within himſelf, the confuſed noiſe of his
paſſions may not hinder him from hearkning to the ſecret checks of inward
truth, and thus he may underſtand what you ſhall tell him afterwards.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>None at all. My Friend becomes ill-humoured when ever I ſpeak to
him: nay, ſometimes he grows angry, and flies out in a paſſion. This
troubles me very much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But doth he laugh no more at what you ſay?</p>

               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>No.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Be of good heart then; your Friend mends, and, I hope, will
recover. He begins now to feel his wounds, ſince he laughs no more when they
are dreſt.</p>
               <p>Should you wonder to ſee a man grow ill-humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and angry if
another filled him with wounds, confuſion and ſhame: why then would you
have your Friend inſenſible? You have told him perhaps ſome truths that
oblige him to leave his pleaſure, <hi>to ſhake off the Old Man,</hi> to be
in a diſpoſition to repent, and appear full of confuſion and ſhame in
the ſenſe of his <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42160:38"/>unfortunate Friends, who will laugh at
his change. He hath had a proſpect of all thoſe things within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and they have ſcar'd him. If he be vext, 'tis becauſe you have wounded him;
and I believe that you have offended him, by Convincing him. Can any thing
grieve and mortifie a worldly man more, than the thoughts of being obliged to
change alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his way of living, and approve by his own example a manner
of life which his Friends ridicule, and he himſelf hath laught at with them
all his life-time? Perhaps your Friend finds himſelf obliged to this. He is
willing to breakhis bonds, but he tears himſelf to pieces: his heartis
divided, and you wonder at his pain and impatience.</p>
               <p>Know, my dear <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that if your Friend heard
you without being moved, it would ſhow that he is not affected with your
words; that they do not reach his heart; that he is not convinced by that
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction which ſtirs us to action, begins our converſion, and makes us
ſuffer, becauſe it ſtrips us of the <hi>Old Man.</hi> So, I would have
you be joyful, not becauſe you have filled your Friend with ſadneſs, but
becauſe his ſadneſs is in all likelihood the ſadneſs that inclines us
to repentance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>You revive me extreamly. Let us go on I pray you in our
conferences, that I may ſtrengthen my ſelf in the knowledge of the proofs
of Religion and Morality to convince my Friend fully.</p>
               <p>You prov'd me t'other day that God hath made us to know and love
him. Pray what conſequence do you draw from that principle? For I grant that
God will not have us to fix on particular good the motion of Love that he
inceſſantly cauſes in us, that we may <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42160:38"/>love him
inceſſantly, not with reſpect to his works, which being below us, are
unworthy of our Love, but in himſelf, and according to the idea we have of
him, as a Being infinitely perfect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>All the Precepts of Chriſtian Morals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon that
Principle. You believe it already, but you ſhall ſee it clearly, when I
ſhall make uſe of it to juſtifie the counſels which the Eternal
Wiſdom hath given us in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I will ſhow you now that this principle is the ground of the
Chriſtian Religion, that owns the need of a Reſtorer, and Law-giver, able
to illuminate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and give a new ſtrength to the Soul; of a
Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and Men, who may offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and eſtabliſh a
Worſhip worthy of God, and able to ſatisfie his juſtice.</p>
               <p>You own that God will be loved with all our ſtrength, that is to
ſay, that all the motion of love he creates in us, end towards him, and that
we love creatures only for him, and not him with reſpect to creatures. But do
you love him always after that manner? do you find no difficulty in the
practice of his Love? do you feel no pain to follow this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to its
utmoſt, or no pleaſure to ſtop it. In ſhort, do you not find often that
the ways of vertue are hard and painful, and thoſe of vice ſmooth and
pleaſing?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I am not more perfect than St. <hi>Paul.</hi> I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
delight in the love of God according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, but I feel in my body
another law that fights againſt the law of my ſpirit. I ſuffer when I
practice vertue: I receive ſome pleaſure in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſible
things in ſpight of all my oppoſition; and am ſo much a ſlave to my
body, that I cannot <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42160:39"/>even apply my ſelf without pain and
reluctancy to things that have no relation to the body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But whence proceeds this pain you reſent in doing well, and this
pleaſure you have in doing ill? You are not the cauſe of your own
pleaſure nor pain, for if you were, ſeeing you love your ſelf, you would
never produce pain in your ſelf, and would ſtill be injoying ſome
pleaſure. Neither is it your body, not thoſe that are about you; for all
bodys are below you, and it cannot be conceived that they may act in you, or
make you happy or unhappy. None but God can act in the Soul. But do you think
that God afflicts you when you do well, or that he rewards you when you do ill?
Do you think that God who deſireth that you may love him with all your
ſtrength, throws you back when you run after him? But when you ceaſe to
follow him, and ſtop at ſome particular good, do you think that he fixes
you on it by the pleaſure you find in it.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> plainly
evinces original ſin, the diſorder of nature, the enmity that is between
God and man, the neceſſity of a Mediator, Lawgiver and Reſtorer; in

in that Principle.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>How, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> do you not ſee it? Do you not
remember the ſyſtem which I explained to you two days ago? But 'tis no
matter. I ask you; Is it not a diſorder, that a ſpirit who is made for none
but God, ſhould ſuffer when he loves God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But you ſay, that it is God that makes him ſuffer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I own it; But is it not a diſorder, that God who hath made
ſpirits for none but himſelf, and gives them no motion but towards
himſelf ſhould repel them from him, puſh them back, and uſe them ill
when they come near him, and cauſe in them ſentiments of pleaſure when
they turn from him, and fix on ſome particular good?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>This is not only a diſorder, but a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This cannot
be. God doth not contradict, nor oppoſe himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> Is it not certain that God makes, and
preſerves us for none but himſelf? Is it not alſo moſt certain that God
alone acts in the Soul, and gives her ſenſations of pleaſure or pain,
when ſhe cleaves to bodies, or when ſhe deprives her ſelf of them. Is it
not God that moves us to love him? and alſo to love bodies, if the pleaſure
we feel at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance may be reckoned a ſufficient reaſon for a
ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſpirit to love then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:42160:40"/>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is true. But how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I have already explained it to you. But yet can this diſorder,
this fight of God againſt himſelf (give me leave to uſe theſe
expreſſions for a while) this want of uniformity we imagin to be in Gods
Actions, proceed from God? God made man for himſelf, and even preſerves him
for himſelf only; but when a man quits the body to unite himſelf to God by
the force of meditation, when a man walks in the ways of vertue to come near
God he feels pain, and this pain proceeds from none but God? Doth not this
ſhow that God is angry with us, and that we have diſpleaſed him? If God
will have us to run after him and to follow and ſeek him, is it poſſible
he can reject and puſh us back, and make us reſent pain when we really
follow him, unleſs at the ſame time there be ſome Enmity between us and
him? Why doth he repel us when we follow him, but becauſe we are unworthy to
come near him? And how are we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to come near him, ſince he is the end
of our Creation, unleſs it be becauſe we are no more ſuch as God had made
us, and he doth not care for us as we are now, and we want a Reſtorer and a
Mediator.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt you have not well demonſtrated yet the Enmity which you
believe to be between God and men. You ſay that God repels us when we would
come near him, becauſe he makes us have a ſenſe of pain in the practice
of vertue and the inquiry after truth.</p>
               <p>But I have two things to object to you; <hi>Firſt</hi> that if
it ſeems that God repeſs and moleſts us by Sentiments of pain, on the
other ſide he comforts us in the deepeſt receſs of our reaſon; for we
feel an inward joy in the practice of vertue which makes us know
ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42160:40"/>that God is our good; and if God did not
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire we ſhould love him, he would not reward us with this inward
comfort; nor create in us thoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter checks and reproaches that make us
uneaſie in the injoyment of ſenſible good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Secondly,</speaker>
               <p>God doth not repel and thruſt us from him when we run after him;
he only gives us notice by ſentiments of pain to ſeek ſomewhere elſe
than in him the good of the body. And as meditation is not conducible to our
health, we ought to feel ſome pain in its practice, that we may leave it off;
for all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pleaſures or pains, are only warnings to the body: and
you ought not to think that God will have us love or hate any thing for the
ſake of the pleaſures or pains we receive in the uſe of them; God will
have us to ſeek or avoid them, for the preſervation of the Body, as you
ſaid two days ago, but he will not have us love or fear them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Whatever you have ſaid now is true, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarchus,</hi> but
it doth not overthrow what I had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht before. I own that God
comforts us by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy when we love him, and that he torments us by
knawing checks when we love the good of the body. After all, what doth this
prove? nothing elſe but that God will have us to love him, and that he hath
made us for himſelf. It is a certain mark that the enmity between God and men
is not full and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; but it is not a ſure ſign of a perfect
friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Sinners have offended God, there is enmity between them and God,
you do not doubt it; and yet God recalls them to him by checks and reproaches:
Yet this doth not ſhew that he loves them perfectly, but only that the enmity
is not entire and abſolute, for it cannot be ſuch, without cauſing their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And do not imagine that theſe checks <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42160:41"/>alone, ſuch as the Heathens felt them, could make them come back,
reconcile and rejoin themſelves to their principle. This call was only to
juſtifie God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and condemn that of Sinners. For in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
it is to be found even amongſt the Damned, who will be eternally recalled,
and eternally repelled and condemned; thoſe checks being a condemnation of
their malice. None return but ſuch as are called back in Jeſus Chriſt;
for nothing but his grace can make this Call efficacious: without the grace of
Chriſt, ſenſible attractions have a greater power than this inward call.
God puſhes us back more than he draws us to him, and if he will have us
becauſe he made us, he will not have us ſuch as we have made our ſelves;
far from this, as ſuch he cannot ſuffer us near him, and always removes us
from him.</p>
               <p>Yet, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> it is true that God is too juſt,
and loves himſelf too much not to deſire to be beloved, and to remove
poſitively from him creatures whom he only made for himſelf; for
ſenſible pleaſure or pain removes from God but indirectly and by our own
fault: Firſt, becauſe being able to find out by reaſon that bodies are
incapable of creating in us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſure or pain, we ought neither to
fear nor love them, but God alone who hath power to cauſe theſe
ſenſations in us.</p>
               <p>When ſomething wounds us we ought to fear God; and when our
ſenſes are any ways pleaſed we ought to think on him, and fear and love
him in all things: For it is a common notion, that the true cauſe of
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and of pain ought to be loved and feared. But our ignorance of the
actual preſence and continual operation of this true cauſe of our
ſenſations makes us love and fear bodies, imagining them to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to
act in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:42160:41"/>Now this ignorance is not ſomething
poſitive, cauſed in us by God: it is nothing. It is true that not to love
or fear bodys, it is abſolutely neceſſary we ſhould have a very clear
and lively knowledge of the preſence and continual operation of God upon us;
for the knowledge which Philoſophy gives us of him doth not ſtrongly enough
diſpoſe us to cleave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly to him.</p>
               <p>But what can be concluded from God's not cauſing himſelf to be
known enough without his grace, to be Loved and feared in all things, but that
men have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and diſpleaſed him.</p>
               <p>God doth not therefore remove us poſitively from him, when he
cauſes ſome pleaſure or pain in us by the means of bodys, ſince we
ought and may then think on him rather than on thoſe bodys. Now I come to the
ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p>Seeing we have a body, it is neceſſary we ſhould have notice
of what paſſes in it. It is neceſſary that at the appearance of objects
we have ſentiments mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us to cleave to, or ſhun them. It is alſo
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that theſe ſentiments be preingaging for ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that I have mentioned elſewhere.</p>
               <p>So God doth not poſitively remove us from him, when he cauſes
in us our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſince on the contrary it is the ſhorteſt means
to warn us of the things that are neceſſary for the preſervation of life
without turning us away from him.</p>
               <p>But thoſe preingaging Sentiments ought not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb us, nor
oppoſe our Reaſon; and ſeeing they do, it is evident, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid it,<note place="margin">2d. Dial.</note> That Man doth not deſerve God
ſhould interrupt the Law of the communication <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42160:42"/>of motions
for his ſake: but this doth not imply, that God really puſhes us back from
him.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, men ſee all things in God; their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate object
is the intelligible world, and the very ſubſtance of God; but they not
thinking on him at the appearance of ſenſible objects, imagine that ſome
outward being altogether like the Idea they have of it, acts in them: Thus God
moves them only towards himſelf, ſince he only moves them towards what they
ſee, and not towards thoſe things which they imagine to be external, and it
is only indirectly and through a miſtake that they love the creatures which
are neither ſo lovely, nor ſuch as they imagin them to be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>You are much in the right <hi>Theodorus,</hi> when you believe
that the firſt cauſe of our diſorders, is our not having God always
preſent to our minds; and not ſeeing or rather not feeling him in all
things. For did we plainly and ſenſibly ſee, that none but God really
acts in us when bodies are preſent to our ſences; methinks we would fear
and love none but him, ſince we love or fear nothing but what acts in us.</p>
               <p>How then could <hi>Adam</hi> eſtrange himſelf from God? for he
could ſee God in all things, and had all the knowledge, that was
neceſſary to remain united to him. If you do not explain how he could fall
into ſin; perhaps <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> will believe that the firſt man
was made ſuch as we are, and that concupiſcence is not ſo much a
puniſhment for ſin, as the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You need not fear it, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> he knows now that we
ought not to leave a demonſtrated Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot ſolve ſome
difficult Points; he now ſticks to what he ſees. But I underſtand what
you mean, and anſwer you thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42160:42"/>The firſt man did clearly ſee God in all
things; he evidently knew that bodies could not be his true good, nor properly
make him in the leaſt happy or unhappy, he was fully convinc'd of God's
continual operation on him; but <hi>his</hi> was no ſenſible conviction, he
knew this but did not feel it: on the contrary he could feel that bodies acted
on him, tho he could not know that they did it. It is true that being endowed
with reaſon, he ought to have followed his light and not his ſentiment; and
that he could eaſily have done it, ſeeing he could ſtop his ſentiments
when he pleaſed, being free from concupiſcence. However deferring too much
to his ſences, and ſuffering himſelf by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to hearken to them more
willingly than to God himſelf, by reaſon that the ſences always move
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly, and God did not move him to hear him by preingaging pleaſures,
which muſt have leſſened his Freedom; you eaſily conceive how he came
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move himſelf ſo far from God, as to loſe ſight of him, to adjoyn
in will to a creature by whoſe means he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome ſatisfaction: and
which he might then confuſedly imagin to be capable of making him as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as the Serpent aſſured <hi>Eve,</hi> it would. For tho <hi>Adam</hi> was
not attackt, nor ſeduced by the Serpent, as <hi>Eve</hi> was. <hi>And Adam
was not deceived,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.14. Yet what God ſaid after <hi>Adam</hi>'s
fall, <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil,</hi>
Gen. 3.22. Sufficiently ſhows that he had ſome hopes of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy by
the means of the forbidden Fruit. Now to determine us to do a thing, there is
no abſolute neceſſity that we be fully perſuaded that our Motive is
juſt and reaſonable. The hopes of a great benefit, tho never ſo ſmall,
are capable of making us do much. So we may ſuppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> was
ſo ſtrongly applied to <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42160:43"/>ſenſible Objects, and,
conſequently, ſo far removed out of God's preſence, that the leaſt
hope, the ſlighteſt doubt, and the moſt confuſed ſentiment of ſo
great an advantage as that of being like God, hath been capable of moving him
to do a thing, which he did not, perhaps, think very ſinful at the time of
his Fall.</p>
               <p>All finite Spirits muſt be ſubject to Error and Sin,
principally if they reſent preingaging pleaſures, which incline them to
ſeek things that they ought not to love, and to ſhun what they ought not to
fear. For no finite Spirit can actually reſent pleaſure, without actually
dividing the capacity he hath to think, and leſsning the knowledge of his
duty, without being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by it out of God's preſence, in ſhort,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakning by little and little his love and his fear, inſomuch that
actual pleaſure ſeems a Reaſon, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Motive to love what is
not worthy of our love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> ought to have remained fixt and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the
preſence of God, and not have ſuffered the capacity of his ſpirit to be
divided by all thoſe pleaſures that were in perfect ſubjection to his
Will, and uſed only to warn him of what he was to do for the preſervation
of his life; and as he ſhould, ſo he could have done it. And had he made a
good uſe of his Free-will, during the time preſcrib'd for a Reward, he
ſhould have been confirm'd in his Righteouſneſs, not only by a more clear
knowledge of God's continual operation on him, but by a ſenſible knowledge
which invincibly fixes on God, all Spirits naturally deſiring to be happy.
For the Saints do not only ſee by a Far-fetch'd, and Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sight,
that God alone is capable of acting in them, and making them happy: But they
alſo feel it by an <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42160:43"/>

I explain'd it to you yeſterday. On the contrary, ſhe ſtrays from the
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when having a motion ſufficient to reach to God, ſhe ſtops at
ſome particular good, and thus hinders God's Act in her. I do not believe it
can be conceiv'd, that ſhe can be orderly or diſorderly another way. If
then I demonſtrate, that by reaſon of the Union which Children have with
their Mother, the Soul of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is by neceſſity turn'd towards Bodies,
that their Soul loves only Bodies, and all her motion confines it ſelf to
ſome ſenſible thing from the moment ſhe is form'd; I ſhall have
demonſtrated the cauſe of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſorder of Nature, and how we are
all born in Sin.</p>
               <p>I prove it thus. There is no Woman but hath in her Brain ſome
Impreſſion that repreſents to her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things; either becauſe
ſhe actually ſees Bodies, or <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42160:44"/>receives her nouriſhment
from them. You do not doubt of this; for, after all, we muſt at leaſt eat
to live; and we cannot eat, but our Brain receives ſome Impreſſion of it,
ſince we remember it. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens alſo no Impreſſion in the Brain,
without being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by ſome Emotion in the Spirits, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Soul to the love of the thing that is preſent to the mind at the time of
that Impreſſion; that is to ſay, to the love of this or that Body: for
Bodies only can act on the Brain. 
<note place="margin">See the 7th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the 2d
<hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Inquiry after Truth.</hi>
                  </note> In ſhort, there is
no Woman but hath in her Brain ſome ſteps and <hi>veſtiges</hi> or ſome
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirits which makes her think, and carries her to ſenſible
things. Now when the Child is in his Mother's Womb, he feels the ſame
Impreſſion and Emotion of Spirits with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore in that
ſtate he knows and loves Bodies. The daily Inſtances we have of Children
that fear or abhor thoſe things that frighted their Mother whilſt they were
with Child, ſufficiently ſhews, that they have had the ſame
Impreſſion, and conſequently the ſame <hi>Idea's</hi> and Paſſions
as their Mothers; ſince they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times never ſaw ſince they were born
thoſe things which they ſo much abhor. And thoſe Inſtances even ſhew
us, that the Impreſſions and Agitations are greater, and conſequently the
<hi>Idea's</hi> and Paſſions more lively in Children, than in their
Mothers, ſince they remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them, and oftentimes their Mothers
no more remember it.</p>
               <p>I perceive, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that you wonder to hear me ſay

               <p>I muſt own, that this amazes me, but it ſeems to me
demonſtrated, however there being holy <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42160:44"/>Women, and full of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>It is becauſe the love of God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate itſelf
like the love of Bodies; the reaſon whereof is, that God is not ſenſible;
and that there are no ſteps in the Brain, that by the inſtitution of
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do repreſent God, nor any of thoſe things that are purely
intelligible.</p>
               <p>A Woman may well repreſent to herſelf God in the Form of a
Reverend old Man: but whilſt ſhe thinks on God, her Child ſhall think on
an old Man; when ſhe loves God, her Child will love old Men; and this love of
old Men doth not a juſtify. All the <hi>Veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> in the Brains of

join'd to thoſe <hi>Veſtiges,</hi> by the Will of Man, or by the
<hi>Identity</hi> of Time, and not by Nature, do not communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to them; for Children in the Womb are not as knowing and holy as their
Mothers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Theodore,</hi> Children are not free: I own, they love
Bodies; but they cannot hinder themſelves from loving them. How then are they
Sinners? How are they corrupt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Their Sin is not of their own chuſing, nor free and voluntary;
yet they are corrupt. For all Spirits that are averſe from God, and inclin'd
towards corporeal Beings, do not follow God's Orders, if it be true that God
will be loved more than Bodies.</p>
               <p>Concupiſcence is not a Sin in virtuous perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is in them a love of choice that oppoſes it. Concupiſcence doth not
reign in them, but it reigns in Children; their natural love is bad, and they
have no other.</p>
               <p>When two ſorts of loves are to be found in a <pb n="76" facs="tcp:42160:45"/>heart, God regards only that love which is free; ſo Dreams are not
ſinful in pious Men, becauſe the love of choice that went before, leaves in
the Soul a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that carries and turns her towards God. But in a
Child, who was never turned towards God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his Nature, and what God
has fixt in him by the Decree of his firſt Will can be good; he is a Child of
wrath, and muſt of neceſſity be damned: For it cannot be conceived that
God will ever reward the diſpoſition of his heart, except you alſo
conceive that God rewards diſorder.</p>

               <p>But, <hi>Theodore,</hi> Was not what you call Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der put into
the Child by God himſelf? Since it is by the Decree of his Will, that upon
certain motions of the Brain, certain thoughts ſhould reſult in the Soul,
and the communication that is between the Brain of the Mother, and that of the

               <speaker>The.</speaker>
               <p>I own it, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> however it is not amiſs: It was
requiſite that the <hi>Veſtiges</hi> in the Brain, and the motions of the
Spirits, ſhould be attended with the thoughts and agitations of the Soul, for
the Reaſons I have already told you, the chief whereof is, That Bodies do not
deſerve the application of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is made for none but God. It was
neceſſary that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be told by preingaging Sentiments, by
ſhort and unqueſtionable Proofs, that ſuch and ſuch things were good
for his Body. It was fit alſo, that the impreſſions on the Mother's Brain
ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate themſelves to that of the Child, for the full
conformation of his Body. Thoſe things are moſt wiſely eſtabliſht;
Diſorder is only found in Deſire.</p>
               <p>It is good that there reſult in the Soul certain thoughts, when
certain impreſſions form themſelves in <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42160:45"/>the Brain; but
it is not good that thoſe impreſſions prompt us to the love of
ſenſible things, and do not vaniſh when we deſire it, or that our Body
be not ſubmitted to us. Now the Sin of the firſt Man hath cauſed this;
for he became unworthy by his Sin, that God ſhould ſuſpend the
communication of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his ſake: ſo not being able to hinder the
impreſſion of the Bodies that act on us, from reaching as far as the chief
part of the Brain, which is the ſeat of the Soul, we have of neceſſity
the ſentiments and motions of Concupiſcence, tho God doth nothing elſe in
us but deprive us of the power to hinder the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral communications of
motions, that is to ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acting in us. For Concupiſcence
preciſely as ſuch is nothing; it is in us only a want of power over our
Body, which want proceeds from our Sin only, ſince it would be juſt without
it that our Body were ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive plainly, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that the union of our
Spirit with our Body proceeds from God, and that our being Slaves to our Body,
proceeds from Sin. All that is plain. But you, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> are you
perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Sentiments and Proofs of <hi>Theodorus?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I dare not aſſent to them, for I fear to be miſtaken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps it is becauſe <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſpeaks of the
tranſmiſsion of original Sin, as of a thing not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be
explained, and you have hitherto believed it to be unexplainable; this may have
prepoſſeſſed you: Or it may be your Sceptical Friends have ſo often
laught at the ſimplicity of thoſe that believe what the Church teaches,
that your imagination hath been formerly ſomewhat ſpoilt by it. For my part
I remember that ſome time ago I was half ſtunned by <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42160:46"/>the
reflection of the amazement that appeared in the looks of one of thoſe
falſe learned, at the appearance of an imaginary difficulty. But remembring
what <hi>Theodorus</hi> tells me continually, not to ſuffer my ſelf to be
impoſed upon by the Air and ſenſible impreſsion of Men, I retired
within my ſelf, and could not help laughing at my pannick fear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that I am ſo much a Fool as to
let my ſelf be impoſed on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>You are too wiſe to do ſo, <hi>Ariſtarchus;</hi> but you are
not yet wiſe enough not to receive ſome impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the bold way and
commanding Air of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People that come to ſee you. It is impoſsible
to be always upon our guard, and compare inceſſantly Mens words with the
anſwers of inward truth; and you ſhall give me leave to tell you, that I
even obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but two days ago by your countenance, that you are a Man born
for company; that you are very full of complaiſance, and very eaſily
embrace the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others: yet the buſineſs was of moment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I remember it, it is true I was moved, that perſon ſpoke to me
in a very ſtrong and lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but I ſoon came to my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps it is becauſe the thing nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned you, and you
were not then about a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Queſtion, or certain Points of
Religion that have nothing common with the Senſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, but really I will no longer believe Men upon their
word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>No, you do not believe them upon their word, for words being
arbitrary, perſuade only as far as they enlighten the mind; but the Air
perſuades na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and by impreſsion: It perſuades inſenſibly, and
without letting us even know what it is that we are <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42160:46"/>perſuaded of; for all it can do by it ſelf is to agitate and
trouble. I ſay it to you, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly believe
above a million of things which you do not know, and which the Commerce you
have with the World hath heapt on your memory. But be not vext at it, there is
no man but hath a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe confuſed Notions, for we are
all ſenſible. There is no man made for Society, but is faſtned to other
men, and receives in his brain the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as thoſe who
ſpeak to him with ſome emotion and force; and thoſe impreſsions are
attended by thoſe confuſed judgments whereof I am ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>Do not imagine that none but Children ſee and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what
their Mother ſees and deſires, as I told you juſt now, when I explained
to you the propagation of original Sin. All men live by opinion, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee and deſire things, as thoſe they converſe with, proportionately to
the need they have of their help. Children are ſo ſtrongly united with
their Mothers, that they ſee nothing but what ſhe ſees. But men are
capable to ſee and think of themſelves, they are not ſo narrowly united
to other men, ſeeing they can live alone, they can think alone; but ſeeing
they cannot live conveniently out of Society, they never think eaſily, and
without pain, but when they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be perſuaded by the air
and way of thoſe who ſpeak to them.</p>
               <p>Is it not true, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that there are ſome
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have prepoſſeſſed you againſt what I have ſaid to
you now of original Sin; not as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> thinks, by laughing at
thoſe things, for you are too well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to have ſtill any deference
for the ſilly banters of the falſe learned; but rather gravely and
piouſly inſpiring you with a ſecret averſion for ſome Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42160:47"/>that ſeem new, and are too clear for ſuch as are not
uſed to ſee the light.</p>
               <p>I know it, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> and plainly perceive, that
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the diſorder which they have cauſed in your mind by the
darkneſs of their terms, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive and ſcientific air of their
quality, hinders you from aſſenting to what I have told you now. But let
not this make you uneaſy, there is a great number of others diſtinguiſht
by the ſame outward marks of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Learning, that approve what your
Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. If I thought it fitter to convince you by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than by
Reaſon, I would let you ſee them; but you ought to convince your ſelf by
ſuch Proofs as may be acceptable to the Perſon whom you deſign to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert. The moſt honeſt men are not infallible, even all thoſe who
ſeem ſo, are not ſuch. But however it be, it is better to be ſenſible
to light, than to the moſt pious and moſt ſanctified Air; becauſe God
always enlightens, and oftentimes the Way and Air impoſes and ſeduces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>This is true, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> but I fear that your Sentiment
is not conformable to that of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But what occaſion have you to fear it? Have you ever read any
thing contrary to it in the Fathers? I ſee you have been told ſo gravely,
and you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it in the ſimplicity of your heart.</p>
               <p>Hath not St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who beſt underſtood the
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature, explained the propagation of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, by the
example of hereditary Diſeaſes? By that of gouty Parents, who beget
Children ſubject to the Gout. And of the ſick Trees, which yield a
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Seed, that produces nothing but bad Trees? For he knew that Original
Sin can only communicate itſelf <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42160:47"/>by the body, becauſe
its principle is in the body, and that in ſome ſenſe it dwells in the
body, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>As for the other Fathers that lived before St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
they never undertook to make a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the manner in
which the tranſmiſſion of that Sin could be explained. Their Age was
neither ſo incredulous nor malicious as ours; and it was not then
neceſſary to give probable explications of our myſteries, to make thoſe
who called themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians believe them.</p>
               <p>No, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> I could never find that the Fathers
were againſt what I have told you now: But I wonder to ſee that you who
formerly uſed to treat the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Authority with ſo much indifference,
are now ſo full of Veneration for the Fathers, as to be afraid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe of diſſenting from them, by admitting ſome explications wherein
we are not always obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, provided we keep with them to the
Faith and Doctrin of the Church.</p>
               <p>You are too credulous, and your apprehenſions are not juſt;
you do not meditate enough; you are like thoſe Children who walk by night
without a light, that are afraid of all things, becauſe they ſee
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Whilſt you did lead a careleſs ſort of life, the air of the
Libertines uſed to perſuade you; and now you ſuffer your ſelf to be
convinced by the air of piety and gravity of certain perſons, who have not
always as much light and charity, as opinion and falſe zeal. You are leſs
in danger of being miſtaken, but yet you are not in the way of truth. You
ought to believe what muſt be believed, but you ought to ſee what 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42160:48"/>may, and conſequently what muſt, be ſeen. I hope that
if you make ſerious Reflections on the things, I have told you, without
troubling your ſelf with what your Friends think of it, your Uncertainties
will be cleared, and you will no more ſuffer your ſelf to be ſcared by a
ſort of Men who aſſume an unjuſt power over the mind of others,
inſtead of bringing them to Reaſon by light and evidence.</p>
               <p>I leave you, with <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> to confer together upon
thoſe things I have ſaid to you, meditate with him, and endeavour either to
convince your ſelf, or to offer to me (that is) in a clear and evident
manner, the Reaſons that hinder you from doing it.</p>

               <p>WE have made many Reflections, <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> and I, upon
Original Sin, and the Contagion that ſpreads itſelf in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: And have
even found that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin is tranſmitted into Children in ſome manner,
as the Sentiments and Paſsions of paſsionate men communicate themſelves
to thoſe that are in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For as the union that is between men
for the benefit of Society, is the cauſe why a man by the air of his Face
ſtamps on the brain of ſuch as are touched by it, the ſame impreſsions
which the Paſsion that moves him forms within him; 
<note place="margin">See the 7th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the 2d
<hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Inquiry after Truth.</hi>
                  </note> ſo the union of the
Mother with her Child being very ſtrict, and the Childs wants very great, the
Child's imagination muſt needs be ſullied by all the impreſsions and
emotions of mind that incline the Mother to ſenſible things.</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> thoſe that live in the hurry of
the world, that are held by too many things, that never conſult their
reaſon, but ſuffer themſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, <pb n="84" facs="tcp:42160:49"/>moved
and run down by every one that hath ſome ſtrength of imagination, and
whoſe air being lively, is conſequently inſectious, thoſe civil men of
the Town, born for Company, who are always ſo ready to receive their Friends
Sentiments; in a word, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> thoſe Perſons that are
ſuch as you have been till now, for you are the civileſt and moſt
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant Gentleman I ever knew, thoſe Perſons, I ſay, that are like
you, have a double portion of Original Sin, that which they received from their
Mother when they were in her womb, and that which they have ſuckt in by the
commerce of the world.</p>
               <p>You are happy, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> in being able to
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the impreſſion of thoſe two Sins. How indebted are you not
to inward truth for calling you back ſo loudly as to be heard by you in
ſpight of the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed noiſe of your ſenſes and paſſions! You
retire, ſometimes within your ſelf, as if your Reaſon was not corrupted,
and the concupiſcence of original Sin had not been ſtrengthned, nor
encreaſed by a concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of thirty years ſtanding. You are ſo much
altered to day from what you were yeſterday, that I believe you will no
longer find any conſiderable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in our following Conferences. For
all that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you from apprehending my ſentiments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the
obſcurity and diſorder wherein the converſe of the world had thrown you:
ſo that being delivered from that diſorder, and reſolved to retire
inceſſantly within your ſelf, you will hearken to the deciſions of that
truth that preſides to all ſpirits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> I renounce all the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that
uſed to prejudice me. I plainly ſee that all manner of union to
ſenſible things, eſtrangeth and removeth us from truth: that the union
which I had <pb n="85" facs="tcp:42160:49"/>in my Mother's womb, made me a Sinner: that the
union which I have had with my Relations, hath only given me a knowledge of the
world, uſeful indeed to unite me with it, and make my ſelf conſiderable
in it, but altogether unprofitable to the inquiry after truth. In ſhort, that
the union which I have had with my Friends and other Men, hath filled me with a
very great number of moſt dangerous prejudices, which you know better than I.
I have hitherto lived by Opinion, I deſire now to live by Reaſon. I will
believe nothing but what Faith and Charity oblige me to believe; in all other
things I will conſult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward truth, and believe only what it ſhall tell
me. I miſtruſt all Men, and even you <hi>Theodorus:</hi> you may ſpeak as
much as you pleaſe, I will not believe you the ſooner for it, if truth doth
not ſpeak as well as you. Your way of ſpeaking is able to impoſe upon
Men, your Air is that of a Man perſuaded of what he ſaith, and that Air is
perſuaſive; you ought to be feared as well as others. I honour and love
you, but I honour and love truth more than you; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love you ſo much
the more, as I find you more united to that truth I love, than a world of
others.</p>

in me nothing but truth. I ſpeak to you, but I do not enlighten you. I am not
your light, nor your good, therefore do not believe me. If my Air and way of

you upon your word. But go on, I pray you. I am inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the
matters which you proved to me yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and even of your way of explaining
the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Original Sin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I told you yeſterday ſome things that are not abſolutely
neceſſary for what will follow. There is no neceſſity of your being
perſuaded of the manner how <hi>Adam</hi> could happen to fall, nor how his
Sin could tranſmit it ſelf into his Off-ſpring. It is enough that you
know that Men are born in Sin and Corruption; that there is an enmity between
God and them; that their body is not under their ſubjection; and that
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their mind is in darkneſs, and their heart in ſin and
diſorder.</p>
               <p>You cannot doubt of theſe things, if you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of
what I told you yeſterday, or make ſome reflections on the ſtrugling that
you feel within you of your ſelf againſt your ſelf, of the law of your
mind againſt that of your body, of your ſelf after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man,
againſt your ſelf after the outward and ſenſible man.</p>
               <p>You believe, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that the order of things is
reverſed, it muſt therefore be re-eſtabliſht. But how ſhall that be
done? Shall it be by the Heathens Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy? They are ignorant of our Ills,
and cannot cure them. Shall it be by the Religion of the Deiſts? They will
not admit of a Mediator. Shall it be by the Law of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> it
encreaſeth Concupiſcence. Shall it be then by the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi>
it is juſt and <pb n="87" facs="tcp:42160:50"/>holy, I own it; but who ſhall keep it?
It ſhews us Sin, it makes us ſenſible of the deceaſe, it makes us know
the want of the Phyſician, and the need of Grace, that there muſt be a
Mediator to reconcile Mankind to God; but it doth not give us that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator:
it promiſes, repreſents and gives us an image of him, but it doth not
poſſeſs him. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf hath need of an Interceſſor
to God; and if he was a Mediator and Interceſſor between God and his
People, it was only as a Type of the true Mediator between God and men. His
Mediation was only to obtain for them a long life upon earth, and temporal
enjoyments, for he doth not promiſe them Heaven: he doth not reunite them to
God: he doth not merit them Charity. In fine, he doth not ſend them the Holy
Ghoſt, that alone removes the fear of Slaves, and alone gives right to the
inheritance of Children.</p>
               <p>None but Chriſt is capable to make peace between God and men:
for none but him can atone the juſtice of God, by the excellency of his
Sacrifice; intercede to God, by the dignity of his Prieſthood; obtain all
things, and ſend us the Holy Ghoſt, by the quality of his Perſon. None
but him that came down from Heaven, can take us thither with him; and none but
him that is united to God by an union of ſubſtance, can reunite us to God
by a ſupernatural union; none but the true Son of God can intitle us to his
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
               <p>God having made all things by his Son, and for him, it was juſt
he ſhould repair all things by him, and eſtabliſh him Head of his Church,
Judge over his People, and Sovereign Lord of all the Creation.</p>
               <p>Who but God-man could retribute to God an honour worthy of him,
have a fellow-ſuffering of our <pb n="88" facs="tcp:42160:51"/>miſeries, and ſanctify
them in his Perſon? Who but him could be predeſtinated before the beginning
of time, as a work worthy of God, repreſented in all Ages as the end of the
Law, and wiſhed for by all Nations, as the only Perſon able to deliver them
from their miſery?</p>
               <p>Man being become ſenſible and carnal, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the Word ſhould be made Man, that the intelligible Light ſhould make
himſelf ſenſible, and that he who enlightens all Men in the deepeſt
receſs of their reaſon, ſhould inſtruct them likewiſe by their
Senſes, by Miracles, Parables, and familiar Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>United as we are to all corporeal Beings, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a dependence
upon whatſoever we are united to, it was neceſſary that we ſhould be
taught Self-denial, Privation and Repentance, and ſtrengthned by the
cheriſhing delights of Grace, as alſo comforted by the ſweetneſs of
Hope.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Religion doth whatever ought to be done: and
Chriſtian Morality teaches whatſoever ought to be known. But I muſt prove
to you more at large, and by a method that may convince your Friend, that none
but the Chriſtian Religion can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the Order that Sin hath
reverſed.</p>
               <p>I begin with thoſe things that concern Religion, and then will
come to Morality.</p>
               <p>I pray you therefore to be attentive, <hi>Ariſtarchus.</hi> Do
you believe that God is merciful?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But can he be willing to do it?</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Men can forgive when they are offended: they ought not to revenge
themſelves, nor have they power to do it. As they love themſelves to
exceſs, they would be ſure to exceed; being Sinners, they would condemn
themſelves; and whatſoever offends them being ordained by God, they would
be guilty of Rebellion. For the only thing wherein God hath no hand, to wit,
the inward malice of their Enemies, doth them no harm: they have no right to
oblige others to love them, neither can they take any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for want of that
love that doth not belong to them.</p>
               <p>But if Men had received the ſovereign wiſdom and power to
judge and puniſh, if their eſſential Will was the Order, if they could
not act againſt that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, might they not puniſh ſuch Crimes as would
be <pb n="90" facs="tcp:42160:52"/>committed againſt God, or pardon Sin and Diſorder,
and yet not offend the Law and Order?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing they could, do you think they might alſo
ſecure to Sinners the means of attaining Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity?</p>
               <p>They would certainly make an ill uſe of their power, and by
overthrowing the order of Juſtice, prove themſelves Sinners, and thereby be
altogether deſtitute of either love to God, or zeal for his glory.</p>
               <p>Do you think God can reverſe the eſſential order of things,
or fight againſt himſelf? Do you imagin it is poſſible he ſhould not
love himſelf, or forbear his own ſatisfaction, by neglecting his Juſtice,
and that mercy which you conceive to be a virtue in us; to be a perfection in
God?</p>
               <p>No, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> God is not merciful in the ſame
manner as we are; that Clemency would be contrary to his Juſtice. That
Sinners be happy, implies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, if not on the part of Sinners, at
leaſt on that of him that is omnipotent, and cannot act againſt the
eſſential order of things, on the part, I ſay, of him that is
eſſentially juſt. God muſt puniſh Sin, and if he hath a mind to
ſpare thoſe that commit it, for the end that he propoſed to himſelf in
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his work, it is neceſſary that a Sacrifice more
worthy of his greatneſs and juſtice than they are, ſhould receive the
blow that was to make them eternally miſerable. Thus God may be
mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.</p>
               <p>Things being thus, you eaſily ſee what need we ſtand in of
Chriſt's ſatisfaction. That the Mediator of the <hi>Arians</hi> and
<hi>Socinians,</hi> is a Mediator who can never atone for them, nor reconcile
them to God: <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42160:52"/>And that none but thoſe who believe that
Jeſus Chriſt is really God, becauſe none but a God can juſtifie and
ſave us, in a word that none but thoſe who call upon Chriſt by that name
which the Scripture gives him, that expreſſes ſo well his qualities,
<hi>Jehovah Juſtitia noſtra, God our Righteouſneſs,</hi> can have a
full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in his Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that God doth whatever he ought
to do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I own it. But God doth whatever he is obliged to for his own
ſake. Men offend and oppoſe him, and overturn the order of things: ought
not he then to revenge himſelf, ſatisfy his Juſtice, and puniſh thoſe
that offend him? For I grant that, as for our ſakes, God is obliged to do no
more than he pleaſeth: But he is obliged to do ſomething for himſelf, and
that being granted, it is juſt to believe that he will not omit to do it; for
he loveth himſelf, and is willing to do whatever he ought to do for
himſelf. I own that there is no Law that conſtrains him, but that he is to
himſelf his own Law. However he is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inviolably a Law, and muſt
of neceſſity love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, tho' nothing forces him to love himſelf,
but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> will you dive into God's Councels, and
give Bounds to his Wiſdom and Power? Do you think that God could not
ſatisfie his Juſtice otherwiſe, than by the death of his Son? If it be
ſo—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I underſtand you, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> God's Juſtice could
have been ſatisfied by a thouſand other means. The leaſt Suffering; the
leaſt Action of God-Man <pb n="92" facs="tcp:42160:53"/>could fully ſatisfy God's
Juſtice for all our Crimes; for the merit of it is infinite, by the dignity
of the Perſon. But God could not be fully ſatisfied by any other
Satisfaction, than that of a Divine Perſon. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is worthy of God, but
God himſelf. All manner of offence againſt God is infinitely criminal, and
there is nothing Infinite but God. He cannot therefore be ſatisfied without
having a hand in it: ſuch is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of his greatneſs.</p>
               <p>Tho' God had ſacrificed all the Creation to his wrath, and
annihilated all his Works, that Sacrifice would ſtill have been unworthy of
him. But God had not made the world to annihilate it, he had made it for him
that hath reſtored it; for his Son was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated before all Ages, to
be the Chief of it. He is the Firſt-born of all Creatures, the Beginning of
the Lord's Ways, the Beginning, End and Perfection of all the Works of God; for
whatever God hath made, is only perfectly worthy of God, through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I don't know, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> whether your thoughts follow
mine, perhaps I run too faſt: But, pray, what is it you would ſay to
me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I'le tell you. God being infinitely wiſe and powerful: why could
he not form a Creature ſufficiently noble, and raiſed above Sinners, to
atone for them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>How! <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> Shall a Creature under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to
reconcile Sinners? Plead for them? Shew any love for them? That is, for the
damned. (For if we are not ranked with the damned, it is becauſe we are made
free in Chriſt.) But, ſuppoſing with you, that a Creature could do all
this, ſatisfie for us, and free us by his ſatisfaction, it follows that we
are indebted to <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42160:53"/>that Creature and his Slaves: that our
obligations to him ought to divide our love between God and him; and that our
Reſtoration being perhaps a greater good to us than our Creation, we ought to
love him better than God himſelf, if we ought to love moſt the things that
do us moſt good.</p>
               <p>Yet God requires that we ſhould love him in all things, and that
all the motion of love which he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in us, tend towards him: and he will
not only be eſteemed by us as the firſt Cauſe and Being, but alſo
beloved in all things, as the only true cauſe of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Creatures
ſeem to produce in us.</p>
               <p>This is the order of things. Now it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, and even
its overturning juſtified, ſhould your Notion of God's deſign to give us
another Reſtorer than himſelf, ſubſiſt. For that deſign would in
ſome manner juſtify a Love not ſolely tending towards God; ſince that
deſign propoſes to us another than God for an Object of our Love, when it
propoſes to us a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endowed with an excellency ſufficient to oblige
us really, and by himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But are we not under ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to other Men that pray for
us? 
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pontificii Loquuntur.</hi>
                  </note> to the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> but that Obligation ought not in
reaſon to divide our Love. All the good will that other Men have towards us
is unefficacious: they cannot do us the leaſt good through themſelves.</p>
               <p>You do not doubt that all other Men merit but in and through
Chriſt; for Chriſt himſelf doth only merit our Salvation, and duly
ſatisfies his Father as he is his Son: ſo that there being nothing really
and in it ſelf capable to do us good without God, all our <pb n="94" facs="tcp:42160:54"/>life ought to tend towards him. This is the order of things, he hath
eſtabliſhed that order at our Creation; for he hath only made us with a
proſpect of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that order, having only made us to love him. How
can it then be imagined that he would deſtroy that order? But let us
ſuppoſe that a Creature ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in his nature were made, and would
ſatisfie for us, and ſacrifice for our ſakes himſelf, and what ever he
hath; his Sacrifice would ſtill be unworthy of God's Juſtice, and his
Satisfaction unequal to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of our offences, ſince any offence
committed againſt God is infinite, by reaſon of his infinite dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>To ſtrike our Sovereign on the Face, is a greater Crime than to
kill our Slave, the offence growing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the dignity of the
offended party, above that of the offender.</p>
               <p>This being granted, it followeth that God would not be fully
ſatisfied by that Creature, and therefore it cannot be ſuppoſed that he
would ever make ſuch a Creature to ſatisfy his Juſtice, if he would be
fully ſatisfied. But do you not think, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that God, who
loves himſelf perfectly, is obliged to do himſelf right, by being willing
to ſatisfy himſelf fully.</p>
               <p>But ſtill ſuppoſing with you, that God might have taken
another Method for the reſtoration of his work, than his Sons Incarnation,
what Religion aſſures us that he hath done ſo? Where is a Creature that
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces us to God, or a Religion that teaches this Myſtery of our
Reconciliation with God? If it be the Religion of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> or
that of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> perhaps it may not be amiſs to follow it: But
there is no other Religion but the Chriſtian, that acknowledges Original Sin,
and the general depravation of Nature, <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42160:54"/>much leſs doth any
other acknowledg a Creature rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above Mankind, by the excellency of his
Nature, to be their Victim.</p>
               <p>For, after all, if the <hi>Jews</hi> invoke <hi>Abraham,
Moſes,</hi> and their Prophets, ſtill they believe them to be Men, and
ſuch whoſe principal greatneſs conſiſts, in being the ſhadow and
figure of their Meſſiah, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Therefore there can be no other
Religion than the Chriſtian, nor any other Mediator than Chriſt; neither
can there be any Religion ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, nor ſo worthy of God, as that we
profeſs; for there is no other way ſo worthy of God, whereby he could have
repair'd his work, as is that we believe he hath taken. In fine, God's work
repair'd is even much more worthy of God, by the holineſs of its Reſtorer,
than it was in its natural perfection.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>What you tell us, ſeems to me very true: If God had not known
that the reparation of his work would yield him more glory than its firſt
conſtruction, it ſeems plain to me, that he would not have ſuffer'd it to
grow corrupt. For, after all, God was not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at <hi>Adam</hi>'s
diſobedience: he hath foreſeen his Fall before his Creation, and alſo the
corruption that Fall was to ſpread over all his work.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> God's firſt deſign
hath been the Incarnation of his Son. We were made for him, tho' he took
Fleſh for us. We were made after his own Image, for he is Man in God's intent
before Mankind was produced. God hath choſen us in him before the Creation of
the World; and made all things by him, and for him. For Chriſt is the Man for
whom God hath made all things. He was predeſtinated to be the chief of Angels
and Saints, even of the <pb n="96" facs="tcp:42160:55"/>Angels that are before the Saints.
But he was before all things in God's deſign, for the members are made for
the head, and not the head for the members.</p>
               <p>As I ſaid it to you,<note place="margin">Dialog. 2.</note> it is
through the Incarnation of the Son, that the Father is worſhip'd as he ought
to be. For what ſignifie the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Men and Angels, if not offer'd
through Chriſt? But if it be certain that God will be worſhip'd as he ought
to be, it is as certain that he will be worſhip'd through his Son; and
therefore it is ſure that God's chief end is the Incarnation of his Son, and
that the Creation of Men and Angels enters into his deſign, only on the
account of his Son; he having made them for no other end, but that he might
receive their adorations through his Son, and ſuffer'd <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin,
and the corruption of Nature, to make way for the Incarnation of his Son; that
is, to make it neceſſary, or be its occaſion.</p>
               <p>All this ſeems moſt certain to me, but pray,
<hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> what think you of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know yet what to think on't.</p>

               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>How! Sir, can you ſtill be in doubt about it? I'le convince you
preſently.</p>
               <p>A Workman that makes a piece of Workmanſhip for his own private
uſe, and ſurely foreſees that if he expoſe it in the way, ſome one or
other will certainly break it, doth not act prudently, if he doth not lay it in
a ſafe place.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I own it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Very well. But if a Workman foreſees, that laying his Work where
he ought to lay it, and where it will be broken, he ſhall be paid infinitely
more for it than it is worth; do you think he ought to hide it, or lay it in an
improper place to preſerve <pb n="97" facs="tcp:42160:55"/>it, principally if he can
without the leaſt trouble to himſelf make ſuch a piece of
workmanſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>In that caſe, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> he ought to place it in its
true and right place, and not alter his deſign, but, on the contrary, make an
end of his work; if not that it may be broken, at leaſt that he may be paid
for it more than it is worth, and lay hold on the accident that will befall his
work, as on a favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of enriching himſelf: for I ſuppoſe
that this ſame workman thinks more on himſelf, and growing rich, than on
any thing elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Obſerve me then. God is that Workman who works for himſelf,
and minds nothing but his own glory. All the pure Creatures cannot honour him
as he deſerves, neither can all his works enrich him. Do you conceive then
that he will make them?</p>
               <p>Beſides, if he makes Man, and leaves him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he
doth not hinder his freedom, and will be loved by him with a love of choice, an
underſtanding love, perfectly worthy a reaſonable Creature; in a word, if
he places Man at firſt in the ſtate he ought to be in, yet foreſees that
Man ſhall ceaſe to love him, and ſhall diſhonour him, do you conceive
that he will make him? Yet, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> we are made, and God is
wiſe. He hath made us to honour him, and the honour we can pay unto him, is
not worthy of him. But beſides this, in ſtead of honouring him as much as
we can, we diſhonour and diſobey him, and prefer the love of the body to
the love of God: he hath foreſeen the corruption of our heart before its
formation. Where lieth then his wiſdom? How will you juſtify it? What think
you of a Workman, who working for himſelf, makes a work that is of no uſe
to him? Remember what you ſaid of a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42160:56"/>who makes a
piece of work, and expoſes it, tho he knows that ſome one or other will
break it. God is wiſe, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> but what hath he done? This he
hath done; he hath predeſtinated Jeſus Chriſt from all Eternity to be the
head of his works, that Chriſt, and all Creatures through him, may pay to him
an honour worthy of him. He hath placed Man in the ſtate he ought to be
placed in, for the Reaſons that have been told you.<note place="margin">Dialog.
2.</note> He hath foreſeen his Fall, and permitted it, that it might advance
his great End. Thus his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is juſtified; and he becomes, if I may
ſay ſo, more rich and powerful than he was. He commands his Son who is his
equal, and judges and puniſhes him for us; he fully revenges and ſatisfies
himſelf for our ſins. But he receives from him, and from us through him,
ſuch honours as are worthy of his greatneſs and majeſty. Now what do you
think of what <hi>Theodorus</hi> ſaid to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks he proves well enough his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. However, all he
hath ſaid now, ſuppoſes in God a plurality of perſons; for no one doth
pay an honour or an atonement to his own ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You miſtake the Point utterly, <hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> far from
this, becauſe no one doth pay an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or an atonement to his own ſelf, I
prove, and do not ſuppoſe in God a plurality of perſons. To convince you
of it, there needs only to reaſſume what <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaid.</p>
               <p>God acts only for his glory, but all the Creation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay him
an honour worthy of him; it cannot therefore be ſuppoſed that he will make
any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, unleſs it be to declare that a pure Creature can yield him
ſome glory. It follows then, that ſince he <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42160:56"/>hath been
pleaſed to make us, he hath done it in order to his glory. But we cannot
contribute to it, unleſs he join with us: Now, as you have well obſerved
it, a perſon cannot honour himſelf; therefore there is in God a plurality
of perſons. It is then neceſſary that a Divine Perſon, and principally
that by whom all things were made, ſanctify by his dignity all other
Creatures.</p>
               <p>The Son ought to offer to the Father a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over which the
Father may reign with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; the Son ought to erect to him a Temple, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he himſelf is the Chief Stone; eſtabliſh a Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whereof he
himſelf is the High Prieſt; and aſſemble a Church, whereof he is the
Head. In a word, he ought to make his work worthy of him, for whoſe honour he
hath made it: And if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God (who never acts but for his
glory) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to produce ſomething out of himſelf, ſeeing no one can
honour his own ſelf, we muſt admit in God plurality of perſons.</p>
               <p>Beſides, God hath from all Eternity foreſeen the diſorder
that was to ariſe in his Work; he could have prevented it, yet hath not done
it. Then the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Work muſt needs be a greater honour to him
than its firſt Creation, ſince God's rule and motive in his operations is
always his own glory. However, the diſorder of Nature, and the ſhame of
Sin, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God much more than the puniſhment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of
Creatures honour him, the offence of Sinners being infinite, by the dignity of
the perſon that is offended; and it being impoſſible that God can be
ſatisfied, unleſs he be our own Mediator. But, as you have wiſely ſaid,
none can pay an atonement to themſelves, and therefore there muſt be a
plurality of <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42160:57"/>perſons in God. It is neceſſary that a
Divine perſon, and chiefly that perſon by whom God made all things, repair
the diſorder that is hapned in his work, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy God for that ſame
work, if God will preſerve it. For, after all, God who ſuffered Sin for his
glory, muſt have deſigned a Sacrifice capable of yielding him more honour,
than Sin can bring him diſhonour. So we muſt conclude, that there is in God
a plurality of perſons, ſince he hath not made Creatures capable of
honouring him as he deſerves, and eſpecially ſince he ſuffers ſuch
Crimes as no Creature can expiate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>But, pray, what do you think of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they cannot ſatisfy
God's Juſtice, and yet he doth not annihilate them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> God did not make them to be
annihilated; but he would not have made them, or would not keep them in being
without Chriſt: for their puniſhment, tho' eternal, is ſtill too ſlight
to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Juſtice of a revenging God. The damned ſhould ſuffer at
leaſt according to their whole capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet they do not; for there are
degrees of pain among them, tho' their Souls being equal, their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to
ſuffer muſt be equal: But Chriſt by his quality bears what is wanting to
honour perfectly the Divine Juſtice, and in the deformity which thoſe
miſerable Wretches cauſe in the beauty of the Univerſe, there is this
order at leaſt, that the inequality of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment bears a proportion
with that of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. However, it would be better for them not to be,
than to have ſuch a miſerable being; it is plain that Chriſt, who merits
the conſervation of their exiſtence, and upholds them in the order of his
Iuſtice, is rather their Judge than their Saviour. Thus, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>
all things ſubſiſt in Chriſt, he preſerves his <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42160:57"/>work after he hath cleanſed it from the filthineſs of ſin, and
reconciles, through his blood, all Creatures with God, as to what concerns the
preſervation of their being: But if he gives peace to Heaven and Earth, he no
leſs kindles an everlaſting War in Hell.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> how all the ſeveral
parts of Religion prove and maintain one another. What I have told you, is not
a Circle without Principles; for my Principles are that we are made, that
Nature is corrupt, and that God acts only for his glory: You do not deny
them.</p>

               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> I am convinced; But I have ſome

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> what I tell you is new to the
generality of Mankind, and to ſuch Chriſtians as do not ſufficiently
underſtand the myſtery of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they profeſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is not known among worldly Men, they do not think on his
greatneſs, neither do they know how he is the beginning and end of all
things. Thoſe holy perſons that read the Scripture with an intention to
find Chriſt, never fail to find him there, for he is in every place of it:
But they have not the ſpirit of this world, but that of God, whereby they
know the greatneſs of the Gift that God hath imparted to them. The outward
and ſenſible Man is not capable of the things which the Divine Spirit
teacheth us; <hi>for the eye hath not ſeen, the ear hath not heard, nor the
heart of man ever underſtood what God hath prepared for thoſe that love
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not only ſpeak of thoſe falſe learned who deny the
corruption of Nature, the neceſſity of Grace, and the Divinity of Chriſt,
yet aſſume the quality of <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42160:58"/>Chriſtians. I alſo
ſpeak of thoſe who live in the boſom of the Church, but have little love
for Religion. It is impoſſible they ſhould be very well learned in the
knowledge of Chriſt, ſeeing they do not love him, and do not ſtudy the
Scriptures, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Chriſtian Religion, perhaps only, becauſe
it is that of their Parents.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You have told us a great many things both to day and yeſterday,
ſince I have ſeen my Friend; I imagin that he wants me, as I do, to know
what he will think of theſe things: I muſt leave you to go to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Do, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> make him ſenſible of the general
corruption of Nature, and the enmity that is between God and man; and endeavor
to demonſtrate plainly to him, the neceſſity of Chriſt's
ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>If you find that he receives your Sentiments as he ought, and is
willing to be inſtructed, immediately fall on the praiſes of our Redeemer,
and ſtir him up to the love of his Saviour, by the conſideration of the
chief obligations he hath to him.</p>
               <p>Tell him, That Chriſt is <hi>the Way, the Truth,</hi> and
<hi>the Life:</hi> That he is our intelligible <hi>light,</hi> that enlightens
us in the deepeſt receſs of our Reaſon; and our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<hi>light,</hi> that inſtructs us by Miracles, by Parables, and Faith: That
he alone is the food of the Soul: That his light is the ſole producer of
Charity, and that none but him can give us the <hi>holy Spirit, whereby we
become the children of God.</hi> Tell him, that he hath been predeſtinated
before all time to be our King and Chief, our Paſtor and Law-giver: That God
receives our Prayers through him only: That we are made clean only by his
blood, and enter into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> only through his Sacrifice.
In ſhort, That <pb n="103" facs="tcp:42160:58"/>Chriſt is all things to us; that in him
we are new creatures, and new men, that have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in
<hi>Adam;</hi> that without Chriſt we are nothing, have right to nothing, but
are ſold to Sin, Slaves to the Devils, and the eternal objects of God's
wrath.</p>
               <p>Uſe all your endeavors to make him think on Chriſt, to unite
him to, and make him eſteem and love Chriſt; and conclude with theſe
words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> I can eaſily ſee it; the Air of

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>As I was well perſuaded of the truth of the Chriſtian
Religion, by the proofs of original Sin, and the neceſſity of a Mediator;
ſo I imagined I cou'd convince him, by propoſing the ſame proofs; but I
know not to what I ſhould attribute the ill ſucceſs of my words: when I
ſpoke to him, inſtead of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, I provoked him, and he rejected
all that I propoſed to him with a kind of ſcorn; he would not ſo much as
agree with me in common Notions, but continually ſaid, that my Reaſons were
the Reaſons of Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Such Anſwers grieved me; I ſtrove to convince him, and
continued to repeat the ſame things, hoping <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42160:59"/>that at
laſt he would reflect, but all my Efforts were entirely loſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſomething ſtrange, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that a Man can't
convince others of the ſame thing that he himſelf is fully convinced of;
for it appears to me, that all Men ought to ſee the ſame things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>If all Men were equally attentive to inward truth, they would all
equally ſee the ſame things; but your Friend is not like you, he is taken
up with a multitude of things, and his pride has now for many years kept him
unconverſant even with himſelf: ſo that abſtracted proofs and
reaſonings built upon No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have no dependance of the ſenſes,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him not, becauſe theſe proofs don't touch him, and becauſe he
has many confuſed reaſons which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his application to them.</p>
               <p>When a Man has diſcovered a Geometrical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, he can
convince all Men of it, to whom he clearly propoſes it, becauſe that
theſe things are ſenſible, that they freely apply themſelves to them,
that there's no reaſon why they ſhould not believe them, that they are not
prepoſſeſs'd by the authority of Men that deny them, and that when they
ſee theſe kinds of truth, they ſee them after a ſenſible manner: But
'tis not the ſame with certain truths which are contrary to our inclinations,
there we think not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and we have many reaſons not to believe
them.</p>
               <p>It's neceſſary, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that I demonſtrate
to you the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, by more ſenſible proofs than
thoſe of our preceding Conferences, it may be your Friend will more willingly
hearken to them.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:42160:60"/>Do you take his place, and object whatever

               <p>Very well, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you ſuppoſe your ſelf

ought not to oppoſe a Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is univerſally received by all

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Right, but this common Reaſon does not juſtifie you, nor will
it juſtifie the moſt extravagant doubts that may be raiſed; but, I may
tell you, that there was never any Man that could be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
accuſed of Impoſture than <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis one eſſential quality of a Cheat to avoid the Light; but
the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> were wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people, in the
ſight of Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting Men, there was a great number of
them, and ſome were repeated every day for many years <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42160:60"/>together: But not to ſtay upon theſe unprofitable proofs, let us
reflect upon the manner how the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were nouriſhed in the
Wilderneſs forty years, every morning the Earth was covered with Manna,
except the Sabbath day; when it was kept till the next day, it was corrupted,
and full of Worms, except the Sabbath day. This Manna ceaſed to fall, when
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had once eaten of the fruits of the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and from that time they never ſaw it

               <p>Can one doubt of a Fact which was continued Forty years? Or can
one attribute to a natural Cauſe this Rain or Dew which fell but for Forty
years, which ceaſed to fall every <hi>Saturday,</hi> and which could not be
kept without corruption but upon <hi>Saturdays?</hi> Is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays</hi> Air
or Sun different from that of other days? Did the firſt Repaſt which the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> had in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> change the face of
Heaven, or the ſituation of the Stars, which cauſed it to rain Manna? Is't
not evident by theſe Circumſtances, that this Rain was not Natural?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But what proofs have you that the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, Joſhua,</hi>

they were Fabulous—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>If they were Fabulous, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>
were Men of a different nature from us, they were Fools, and ſtupid, to a
very improbable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>Think you, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that Men who have but a little
of common Senſe, would without Reaſon or Examination receive Books as
authentic, and as a Rule of their Faith and Conduct. I'll explain my
ſelf.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:42160:61"/>Think you, that a whole Nation would ſubmit
to a Law, ſo very ſevere and painful, by the force of Arms, or ſome
reaſon of Intereſt, without being compelled thereto, as 'twere, by Divine
Authority?</p>
               <p>Think you, that upon a Fabulous Hiſtory, derived from our
Anceſtors, we ſhould be ſo ſtupid and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, blindly to
ſubmit our ſelves to a Ceremony ſo ſhameful and incommodious as is that
of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? How can it be imagined that the <hi>Jews</hi> receiv'd the
Law which they obſerve, and the Books which they call Canonical, without
conſideration? Theſe Books flatter them not, they continually menace and
reproach them with the ſtupidity, infidelity and malice of their
Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were not obliged by force of Arms to receive
theſe authentic Books, wherefore do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them? wherefore do they
preſerve them ſo carefully? wherefore are there no Men ſo conſtant as
they to the Religion of their Fathers? 'Tis, without doubt, either becauſe
the <hi>Jews</hi> are not Men as we are, or rather becauſe their Religion and
Books have all the poſſible characters of truth.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you believe that God hath made us to
know and love him, and to make uſe of the moſt reaſonable Religion; for
there muſt be an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip for Men that make uſe of their
ſenſes, and who live in ſociety. We muſt then, of all Books that treat
of Religion, believe thoſe that have the greateſt appearance of truth; but
there are none comparable to the Scripture, for the Reaſons I have told you,
as alſo for innumerable other Reaſons. We ought then to look upon theſe
Books as our Rule, and there to ſearch the Religion which we ought to
ſollow. And if we deceive our ſelves in the choice <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42160:61"/>of
theſe Books, our Error would only depend on this, that there would be no mark
to diſcern ſacred Books from profane; or rather from this, that there would
be neither ſacred Books nor Religion which were pleaſing to God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, I believe the end of Beaſts is to eat and drink.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Then God hath made the Soul of Beaſts for the enjoyment of their
Body, but the Soul of Beaſts is more noble than their Body. Then God has not
well ordered his work, nor propoſed to Beaſts an end worthy of them, if
that which makes them more <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42160:62"/>happy and perfect, muſt be
more noble than that which receives its happineſs and perfection. Thus you
ought to obſerve, that God has not given to Beaſts a Soul diſtinct from
their body, or more noble than it; or elſe you ought to begin again, and
ſay, that Beaſts have ſome other Felicity than that of drinking and
eating, and of enjoying their Body.</p>

               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>This Reaſon convinces me, but what would you conclude from
thence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you believe that the <hi>Jews</hi>
were Men as we are, and that they had a Soul, I would ſay a Subſtance which
thinks, perceives, wills, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and is diſtinct from the Body; your
Friend, whoſe place you take, being a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> does not doubt of
this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, he proves demonſtratively, that the Exiſtence of
the Soul is more certain than that of the Body.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>This being granted, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> I ſay that
<hi>Judaiſm,</hi> as to the Letter, is not a Religion which God has
eſtabliſhed for Men; and that it could not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Jews</hi> either
more perfect, or more happy, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> propounded no other
Felicity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the enjoyment of the Body; and that this
ſort of happineſs is only proper for Beaſts, if it is true that Beaſts
have a Soul.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Moſes</hi> had propounded this carnal and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of things to come, 
<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> he promiſed that if they
would obſerve it, their Land ſhould be fruitful; that they ſhould have
great Families, and numerous Flocks; that they ſhould be Maſters over their
Enemies; and that God would preſerve them <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42160:63"/>as a People
which he had choſen: But if they would not obſerve it, he told them that
they ſhould want all the neceſſaries of life, and foretold thoſe
temporal Evils which are come upon them. In fine, he promiſed no other
recompence or puniſhment, no other happineſs or miſery, than the
enjoyment or privation of Bodies; it ſeems there was no Hell, no Paradiſe,
no Eternity for the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But whence comes that? 'Tis certain the <hi>Jews</hi> were very
groſs and carnal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> were
groſs and carnal, but becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> being only the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
could only promiſe good things in a Figure, and could not bring them into the
inheritance of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The chief Prieſts, according to the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> entered into the Sanctuary made with hands, which was only a
Figure of the true one. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered there with the blood of He-Goats and
Calves, which could not purifie the Conſcience; therefore the Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi> could not juſtifie men, it gave them no part in eternal
happineſs; therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to promiſe them any ſuch
thing; that was the propriety of Jeſus Chriſt, who is entred with his own
blood into Heaven, the true Sanctuary, and who hath purchaſed eternal
Salvation, as being the onely High-Prieſt of good things to come.</p>
               <p>Can you think that the <hi>Jews</hi> were more carnal than the
Heathens? Can you imagin that <hi>Moſes</hi> was more groſs than Poets, who
make mention of their gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo unworthy a manner? But the Heathens
thought of another life. The Poets ſpeak of the <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields, and
of Hell, as places deſtined for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Virtue, and the
puniſhment of Vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42160:63"/>There is no Motive more ſtrong, no Idea
more terrible, no Recompence more agreeable than that of Eternity; and the
moſt barbarous Nations are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being ſmitten, ſhaken, and carried
on to the exerciſe of Virtue by this thought, that they would be eternally
rewarded for it; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> reckons a great number of Bleſſings
and Curſings, without mentioning Eternity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis becauſe he did not believe there were Spirits; he believed
not the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>This Conſequence is very juſt, and did I not know that the Law
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, was a Figvre of the New
Covenant, I perhaps might think my ſelf obliged, by the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I owe to
the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of the
<hi>Sadducees;</hi> for only this Party appears reaſonable, as I have already
ſaid, for I have not yet ſpoken any thing that overthrows it. But as your
Friend is a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> he is too much convinced of the Immortality
of the Soul, and that <hi>Beings</hi> which think, are diſtinguiſht from
matter that cannot think, to draw the ſame Conſequences as you do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, this muſt convince him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Nevertheleſs he was not convicted of it. I could wiſh that the
Body were our true happineſs; but is this happineſs capable of recempencing
thoſe who fulfil the precept of loving God <hi>with all their heart, with all
their ſoul,</hi> and <hi>with all their might?</hi> This might, perhaps, be a
ſufficient reward to the <hi>Roman</hi> Virtue, for happineſs muſt be
proportionable to its Virtue. But is this worthy of God? Is this ſufficient
to make thoſe truly happy, who truly love him? You ſee plainly,
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that they are not. Why then <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42160:64"/>did
<hi>Moſes</hi> enjoin us to love God <hi>with all our might?</hi> And why did
he only promiſe us the enjoyments of our Bodies, for the recompence of this
love, unleſs it be that the love of God is indiſpenſibly above all
things, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to promiſe the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he
could not give?</p>
               <p>This ſeems to me ſufficient, to convince you, that
<hi>Judaiſm</hi> was but the ſhadow and figure of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that the
<hi>Old Covenant</hi> only repreſented the true reconciliation of God with
Men; and that the Prieſts, (according to <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Order) the
Sacrifices, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, ought to be abrogated by the Sacrifice
of the <hi>Lamb without ſpot, which takes away the ſins of the world;</hi>
which worthily ſatisfies the Juſtice of God, which introduces us into the
<hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and promiſes the true happineſs to all thoſe who
are members of that Body, whereof he is the Head.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that I have no deſign to become a <hi>Jew,</hi>
unleſs you believe me ſtupid enough to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body as my proper
good; the Body, I ſay, which can't be the happineſs of Brutes, if they have
a Soul diſtinct from their Body, and more Noble than it.</p>
               <p>But as for you, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you have now a deſign to
turn <hi>Turk,</hi> (I ſpeak to you, as you take upon you the character of
your Friend) you are for a Paradiſe, where you would always be indulging your
ſelf in ſenſual pleaſure, you would have many Women to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thoſe Paſſions which are even here below called brutiſh, and
ſhameful<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. <hi>of Order.</hi> Chap. <hi>of

<hi>Mahomet</hi> promiſes them as fair as <hi>new laid Eggs,</hi> and as

            <sp>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42160:64"/>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>Enough, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion is
certainly unworthy of reaſonable Men, it is even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Beaſts, if
they have a Soul more Noble than their Body: And I acknowledge that the
<hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> deſtroys itſelf by its own Principles, as well as
<hi>Judaiſm</hi> does in the Letter. For, <hi>in fine,</hi> 'tis certain that
the enjoyments of the Body are not worthy of the Soul: That thoſe who love
them, become not thereby more perfect. That thoſe who enjoy them, are thereby
often aſhamed: And that the promiſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> (not to mention
thoſe of <hi>Mahomet</hi>) are unworthy of Mankind; for even the Heathen
Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers themſelves went thus far. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have us
deſpiſe theſe Goods, altho' the Law promiſes them; and he declares
thoſe to be happy who are deprived of them, and who are miſerable and
curſed according to the Law.</p>
               <p>Thus, I am ſatisfy'd, that the promiſes of the Law were only
figures; for thoſe amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> who had Charity, could not
deſire the accompliſhment of theſe promiſes as their true good, but,
perhaps, the Law in it ſelf was good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You perceive not that there muſt be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation betwixt the good
which the Law promiſes, and the Law itſelf; and that if the Law juſtifies
really, and by itſelf, the recompences of the Law muſt be good in
themſelves, and make a truly juſt Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: But Men can't be juſt
themſelves, and only deſire theſe Rewards. The juſt then could not
truſt in the Sacrifices and Ceremonies of the Law, they were to expect the
Meſſiah, that could promiſe them ſuch a happineſs as they might
lawfully wiſh it.</p>
               <p>There were two ſorts of <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law;
<hi>Jews</hi> after the Spirit, and <hi>Jews</hi> after the Letter. Thoſe 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42160:65"/>who had the Spirit of the Law were Chriſtians, for
<hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law;</hi> and thoſe were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with
the circumciſion of the heart, and had put off the old man; explaining the
whole Law, its Ceremonies and Promiſes, by their relation to the Meſſiah,
and that eternal happineſs which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him.</p>
               <p>They were not ſcandaliz'd when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpoke on the
behalf of God to the <hi>Jews</hi> according to the fleſh, Iſa. 1.10,11.
<hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye Princes of</hi> Sodom; <hi>hearken to the Law
of our God, ye People of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah. <hi>What have I to do with this
multitude of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices chat ye offer to me, ſaith the Lord? All this is an
abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to me, I love not the ſacrifice of your Rams, nor the fat of
your Flocks, nor the blood of Beeves, Lambs and He-Goats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſung with joy in the ſame Spirit with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
Pſal. 50. <hi>For thou deſireſt not Sacrifice, elſe would I give it,
thou delighteſt not in burnt-offerings.—Lord, do good in thy good
pleaſure unto</hi> Sion, <hi>build thou the walls of</hi> Jeruſalem,
<hi>then ſhalt thou be pleaſed with the ſacrifices of righteouſneſs,
with burnt-offerings, and whole burnt-offerings, then ſhall they offer
bullocks upon thine Altar.</hi> In fine, they ſighed inceſſantly towards
Heaven, to draw down the true Meſſiah, who was to deliver them from their
ſins.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> according to the fleſh, gloried in the
ſhameful ſignature of the circumciſion of their bodies; they were
uncircumciſed in heart, they had a vail which hid the end of the Law from
them. They pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their confidence in their Sacrifices and Ceremonies in the
Ark, and in the Temple of the Lord; in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Abraham,</hi> and their
other Patriarchs. They were full of Zeal and Fury againſt the true
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and <pb n="117" facs="tcp:42160:65"/>continually perſecuted the
Prophets which had the Spirit of the Law, and which reproved their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> after the Spirit were true Chriſtians, they
were always ready to acknowledg and receive Jeſus Chriſt whenever he
ſhould come; for the Moral of the New Teſtament is wholly conformable to
the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their heart, ſince they acknowledg that the goods of
the ſenſes were unworthy of their love. And as they explain'd not holy
Scripture according to the Letter, but according to the myſtical Senſe, and
with relation to the Meſſiah, whom they expected; ſo the proofs which the
Apoſtles took out of the Old Teſtament to juſtifie the quality of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely conformable to their Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles were heard by thoſe
amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> who were moved by Charity, but the carnal
<hi>Jews</hi> who had their heart vail'd, could not, nay, even would not
comprehend the proofs which the Apoſtles gave of the Truth they preacht.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But muſt it not be confeſſed, that the proofs which the
Apoſtles drew from the Old Teſtament to confirm the New, were very
weak?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>They were no proofs, or at beſt extravagant ones to the carnal
<hi>Jews;</hi> and thoſe who know not diſtinctly that the Old Teſtament
is only for the uſe of the New; that <hi>Abraham, Joſeph, Joſhua, David,
Solomon,</hi> are only in the Scripture becauſe of <hi>CHRIST;</hi> and that
whatever hapned to the <hi>Jews,</hi> were but figures of things to come.</p>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> if the literal Senſe of the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the chief end, then S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles prove
nothing; nay, they are mad Men, and fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. But he muſt be the moſt
ſtupid and raſh of all <pb n="118" facs="tcp:42160:66"/>Men, who can imagin that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had not common Senſe; that he would render himſelf ſo very
ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to wreſt paſſages of Scripture, to convince the <hi>Jews</hi>
how unprofitable their Sacrifices and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were.</p>
               <p>For, after all, if we can't believe that the Letter of the Law
rather adminiſters death than life, after what I have already ſaid; I ſee
not, but that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at leaſt that there were ſome Men
amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> who ſearch'd into the Law for another Senſe
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the literal, ſince S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> does not make uſe of the
literal Senſe to convince them of the Meſſiah's coming. Do not you know
that even the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Commentators, who are the declared Enemies of
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> refer moſt of the paſſages to the Meſſiah, which the
Apoſtles do to <hi>CHRIST;</hi> altho' theſe paſſages might often be
underſtood of <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> or others: for, as the truth is, we
muſt conſider theſe perſons as figures of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Letter of the Scripture does, by Divine Providence, contain
ſo many things which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unworthy of God, and even contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
that thoſe who are not entirely ſtupid, find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to
abandon it. I have proved this to you, by the Rewards which <hi>Moſes</hi>
propoſed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which, as you your ſelf have freely granted,
are not only unworthy of ſuch who love God above all things, but in general
of all other Beings which are more noble than Bodies.</p>
               <p>Thus we can't reaſonably doubt, but that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
from the times of the Apoſtles expected the Meſſiah, and who believed him
near at hand, were very much diſpoſed to receive him in that capacity which
the Apoſtles had deſcribed to them, provided <pb n="119" facs="tcp:42160:66"/>the love
of ſenſible things hindred them not from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him.</p>
               <p>God always diſpoſes things after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that
thoſe who love him, do always find him; he leaves ſuch footſteps after
him, that thoſe who feel the inward motions of Charity, do highly acknowledg
him. And if falſe Prophets back their Lyes with Miracles, 'tis becauſe God
tempts Men, to diſcern thoſe who love him; for thoſe who love him are not
deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CHRIST</hi> is ſo concealed in the Scriptures, that thoſe
who love him not, do not find him there. He is not only come to enlighten the
blind, but alſo to blind the wiſe. He is come to reprove the glory of the
world, for this is an abomination before God. In fine, he is come to preach the
Goſpel to the poor, the ſimple and ignorant; and to paſs by thoſe who
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with their own riches and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>There are many obſcurities in the Scripture, but there are
alſo many things that are extremely clear; good Men reſt upon what is
clear, and pay a deference to what is obſcure, as their reaſon directs
them. The pretended wiſe Men and the wicked, who are angry to ſee what they
hate, endeavor to obſcure the light by darkneſs; they endeavor to blind
their own eyes, and are but too ſucceſsful in their attempt.</p>
               <p>If <hi>CHRIST</hi> had come in ſplendor, as he will at his
ſecond appearance, if the Prophecies had been ſo evident that it had been
impoſſible not to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them. In fine, if the Chriſtian Religion
had been ſuch, as that its truth might have been acknowledged without any
application of the mind, and without any love for God, then the negligent and
wicked would <pb n="120" facs="tcp:42160:67"/>have received a grace which they did not
deſerve. God only gives himſelf to thoſe who love him; the truth is only
diſcovered to thoſe who ſeek after it; for if it be juſt to apply one's
ſelf to a Problem to find out its reſolution, 'tis neceſſary that the
Sovereign Good, which is the greateſt truth, ſhould be ſuch, that it may
not be diſcovered without carefully ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it.</p>
               <p>Men little eſteem that which they acquire without labour, they
have but a mean love for that which they have not deſired: Thus it was
neceſſary <hi>CHRIST,</hi> whom we have ſo much need of, ſhould cauſe
himſelf to be deſired and ſought after, before he would be found; and
'tis our happineſs that he is hid after ſuch a manner that he can't be
ſought after without being found.</p>
               <p>Certainly all the obſcurities which are in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies can't
hinder, but that we may evidently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Meſſiah is come. 'Tis
now ſo many Ages ſince, that the time prefixt is paſt over, that there is
now no more need of Miracles: For if Miracles were neceſſary when the
Apoſtles preacht <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> 'tis becauſe the time of the
Meſſiah's coming was not ſo preciſely fixt, but that one might yet
expect him.</p>
               <p>If in the Life of <hi>CHRIST</hi> are found things which appear
ſomething ſtrange; if, for inſtance, his condemnation to death by the
chief Prieſts, ſeems unworthy of the Meſſiah, even theſe very things
ſhould make him to be received, becauſe they were foretold, and being
ſtrange, they can only relate to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42160:67"/>If all the <hi>Jews</hi> had received
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when he appeared, perhaps the modern <hi>Jews,</hi>
the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and the <hi>Pagans,</hi> might have had reaſon to
doubt whether he was the true Meſſiah, they might believe the Scriptures
were corrupted; but the <hi>Jews</hi> being always oppoſed to <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> are credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And we can't reaſonably imagin
that the Books which the <hi>Jews</hi> received were corrupted in favor of
us.</p>
               <p>But if Holy Writ is not corrupted in Eſſentials, if 'tis
certain that it is a Book whoſe authority was not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the
force of Arms, or doubtful Miracles; if we are ſure that the literal Senſe
is not the chief point of it, then we can't doubt the truth of the Chriſtian
Religion, becauſe <hi>CHRIST</hi> is found there all along, even when there
was no <hi>Jew;</hi> I would ſay, when there was no love for ſenſible
good things, and when there was no formal oppoſition to receive
<hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's nothing, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> more comfortable to a Man
that deſires true happineſs, who meanly looks upon himſelf here below as
in a ſtrange Land, who continually reflects upon his inward miſery, and the
War that his domeſtic Enemies wage againſt him; there's nothing, I ſay,
more comfortable, nothing more inſtructive altogether for a Chriſtian, than
to read the ſacred Books; for all that is written, was written for our
inſtruction, that our hope ſhould be ſtrengthned by the patience and
comfort which the Scripture affords us.</p>
               <p>Men find themſelves in it every where deſcribed as they are
either under ſin or puniſhment, but God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pure mercy,
always remembring the promiſe which he made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaves his
people, <pb n="122" facs="tcp:42160:68"/>altho' they deſerve it not; for he hath ſworn
it by himſelf: he redeems them out of the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
brings them into the promiſed Land; but does not utterly deſtroy the
<hi>Canaanites,</hi> 'til the day that King <hi>Solomon</hi> becomes Maſter
of all the Enemies of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Who is ignorant of the ſignification
of theſe things?</p>
               <p>I can't particularly explain to you the Prophecies and Figures of
the Old Teſtament, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New. I don't pretend to
deprive you of the ſatisfaction of diſcovering them your ſelf; what I
ſaid is ſufficient to induce you to read the Scriptures as a devout
Chriſtian, and I deſire no more. 'Tis enough that if you read them, you
will underſtand ſo much as will be neceſſary to confirm you in the
truth of Religion, and to perſuade your Friend, if he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be
inſtructed.</p>
               <p>I'm certain that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> will be pleaſed to join with
you in this Study. I'm ſatisfied that he has a love for Religion, and 'tis
high time that he wholly apply himſelf to things which are only capable to
make him as happy as he can be in this life. There can be no true happineſs
but in the enjoyment of real good: But in this life we can only poſſeſs
it through hope. We cannot therefore be happy in this life, but in avoiding
every thing that weakens this hope, and in ſeeking after every thing which
ſtrengthens it.</p>
               <p>Thus thoſe are miſerable that are united to the Body, and by
its enjoyments weaken their hope: But <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is happy if he
contemns it; and if by the ſtudy of Religion and Chriſtian Morality he
encreaſes his hope, ſo that future happineſs appears to him as if it were
preſent; and a foretaſte of eternal good things is more agreeable to him,
than the reliſh of momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pleaſures.</p>

               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I Waited for you, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of
my Joy; for I have, at laſt, found a means to make my Friend hear me. I no
longer ſpeak to his Ears, I, as it were, ſpeak now to his Heart. I have
made him underſtand moſt of the things whereof we have diſcourſed, and
he ſeems to be very well ſatisfied about them.</p>
               <p>I muſt tell you how things paſſed betwixt us. I had been
ſo offended at his Stupidity and Brutiſhneſs when I met him laſt, that
as I went home, I often repeated to my ſelf the words of Chriſt,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Do not caſt your Pearls before Swine,</hi> &amp;c.
This did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me with a Conſolation ſomewhat ſenſible, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
and Revenge having ſome ſhare in it; for I muſt confeſs that I was
ſomewhat angry, and already began to be concerned for having loved ſo much
a perſon who ſeemed to be out of his ſenſes. Having therefore very much
reflected on that ſaying of our Saviour, I no ſooner ſaw my Friend again,
but it was preſent to my mind; and I do not know how I came 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42160:69"/>to perſuade my ſelf that I ſhould be guilty of want
of reſpect towards the words of the Goſpel, ſhould I ſpeak any more to
him about the Truths of Religion, ſo that I ſtood before him without
ſaying any thing. But if my mind did not expreſs itſelf by the ſound of
my voice, my heart ſpoke ſufficiently by the air of my face; and my Friend
might well imagin that I was not come to ſee him ſo early, merely to bid
him good morrow.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, he being in the main a Man of a civil and
mild diſpoſition, I cannot doubt but that he repented himſelf of the
Anſwers he had made me, and had pondered on thoſe things which I had told
him, with a ſtrength and plainneſs ſufficient, as I thought, to convince
him, if he had any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected. Withal ſeeing me ſo early come to ſee
him, after the many expreſſions he had uſed, which ought to have made me
decline his Society for a long time, being of the temper that I have mentioned,
he could not help being moved by my zeal, and ſorry for his want of
attention.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, whether he was ſhaken by my former Reaſons, or
touched by ſome ſentiments of Friendſhip and Gratitude, he began, after
he had been ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſilent, with an acknowledgment of his fault and
of his ſorrow. After this, he prayed me to repeat once more the proofs that I
had offered to him of the Chriſtian Religion, aſſuring me that he had
thought on them ſeriouſly, and that he had found much ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and light
in them, how imperfectly ſoever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them. I at firſt was
ſomewhat unwilling to comply with his deſire, ſtill remembring the words
of Chriſt; but ſeeing him perſiſt in his demand with heat and
eagerneſs, I believed that he was diſpoſed to <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42160:69"/>hear
me: Accordingly I gave him the ſatisfaction he deſired, and he hath
received, without difficulty, the ſame things that he had rejected with
ſcorn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You ſee even by this, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that it was
convenient that Chriſt ſhould cauſe himſelf to be expected during many
Centuries, and hide himſelf in the Scriptures for thoſe who do not care to
find him.</p>
               <p>We eaſily receive what we deſire, and find with pleaſure
what we ſeek with paſſion. Your Friend could not ſee two days ago that
Truth which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him, becauſe he did not ſeek it: but he hath
diſcovered it, becauſe he deſired it; and hath found it with pleaſure,
if he hath ſought it with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>If Men do not know God, 'tis becauſe they do not care to know
him; and if they do not ſee the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, 'tis
becauſe the love of ſenſible things prepoſſeſſes them, and makes
them hate a Religion that deſtroys it.</p>
               <p>All our Paſſions juſtifie themſelves, and ſpeak
inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly for their conſervation; and thoſe that hearken to the
dictates of their Paſſions, find themſelves ſo ſtrongly moved with
compaſſion towards them, that for their ſakes they deſpiſe the Laws
which condemn thoſe Criminals to death. For indeed nothing is more
deſpicable than the Chriſtian Religion, if we believe our Paſſions, The
Goſpel hath nothing that appears pleaſing, it preaches nothing to us but
ſelf-denial; and Chriſt doth by the example of his life and death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the conduct of thoſe who fix their minds on ſenſible things.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore who eſteem nothing beſides the objects of
their Senſes, who blindly follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb n="126" facs="tcp:42160:70"/>of their
Paſſions, voluptuous Men, or, to uſe the words of Chriſt,
<hi>Swine</hi> are uncapable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the truth of Religion, and
enjoying true happineſs. The Kingdom of God is a <hi>Pearl,</hi> for which
they will not ſell all what they poſſeſs; they do not know the value of
it.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt will not have us to propoſe future
happineſs to thoſe Wretches, nor explain ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to them,
they being uncapable and unworthy of them. We are only to threaten them in the
Name of God, and make them afraid by the Idea of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or even by the fear
of temporal Ills. But when they grow penitent, deprive themſelves of worldly
pleaſures, and ceaſe to be Swine, it is neceſſary we ſhould explain
to them the Myſteries of Religion, and the Secrets of the Goſpel; for being
then become Sheep they hear, and can diſcern the voice of the true Paſtor
of their Souls.</p>
               <p>For this Reaſon, and ſeveral others, which you will perhaps
underſtand by the Sequel of our Diſcourſes, I did not much approve of the
deſign you had to relate all things to your Friend; I was aſraid for you,
and had no hopes of him: But God, who diſpoſes of our hearts, hath rewarded
your Charity and Zeal, and you ought to return your thanks to him for't.</p>
               <p>We have hitherto diſcourſed of the Proofs that concern the
Truth of Religion; and I believe that what I have ſaid, is ſufficient to
perſuade reaſonable perſons, that there is no other Religion in the world
beſides the Chriſtian, able to re-eſtabliſh the Order which Sin hath
reverſed; that none beſides God-man could ſatisfie God's Juſtice,
reconcile us, and give us an acceſs to him, and in a word, pay to God a
worſhip worthy of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:42160:70"/>It is time to ſhew you that Chriſtian
Morality is perfectly conformable to Reaſon, and that in the ſtate to which
Sin hath reduced us, nothing more uſeful to re-eſtabliſh the order of
things can be preſcribed, than the precepts and counſels of Chriſt
concerning Prayer, and the privation of ſenſible things; for I ſuppoſe
no others.</p>
               <p>I entreat you to obſerve carefully whatever we ſhall ſpeak
of hereafter; for you ought rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct your Friend in thoſe things
which reſpect the government of our manners, than in ſuch ſpeculative
truths as are above the capacity of a carnal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Man.</p>
               <p>I will put ſome Queſtions to <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> for I have
not ſaid any thing to him this good while.</p>
               <p>Do you remember, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> what we have ſaid
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the End and Order which God propoſed to himſelf when he created
Man, and are you convinced of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I remember it, and am convinced of it. I believe that God acts for
none but himſelf: that when he makes a Spirit, it is that this Spirit may
know him; and that when he makes a Will, it is that this Will may love him.</p>
               <p>This Order ſeems to me ſo neceſſary, that I do not believe
that God preſerves any Spirit, but what in ſome manner knows and loves him.
I believe that the Union which Spirits have with God by their knowledg and
love, cannot altogether be diſſolved without annihilating them.</p>
               <p>For what kind of being were that Spirit that ſhould know and
love nothing? But all Spirit that knows and loves, knows and loves only by the
means of the Union which he hath with God; ſince he is not to 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42160:71"/>himſelf his light, and that the motion which he hath
towards good in general, and which makes him capable of loving private good,
doth not proceed from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor from any thing below him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>That's true, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> all Spirits are eſſentially
united to God, nor can they be entirely ſeparated from him without ceaſing
to be. But what ought to be their Union with God, that they may be as happy and
perfect as it is poſſible for them to be?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is plain that this Union ought to be the narroweſt that can
be, for none but God is the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign good of Spirits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> we become more perfect the greater and
the ſtronger the Union, which we have with God, is. The damned have but
juſt ſo much Union with God, as is neceſſary to keep them in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But the bleſſed are united to God in ſo perfect a manner, that they do
not only receive from him a being, but alſo its perfection. Let us ſee
therefore, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> wherein conſiſts this kind of Union with
God, whereby we receive all the perfection whereof we are capable in this
life?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I have learn'd in the Conferences which I have had with you, and
by the peruſal of the Book <hi>of the Inquiry after Truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 8. of the laſt Book.</note> that God alone is the true
cauſe and true mover as well of Bodies as of Spirits, and that natural
cauſes are only occaſional cauſes which determin the true cauſe to act
in conſequence of his eternal Will.</p>
               <p>I am perſuaded that I can be united to the Bodies that are about
me, and to that which I animate and move, only becauſe I am united to God; 
<note place="margin">Dialog. 1.</note> for all Bodies cannot 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42160:71"/>by themſelves act in my Soul, nor make themſelves
viſible to her, as ſhe likewiſe hath not by herſelf the ſtrength to
move any Body, ſince ſhe doth not even know what muſt be done to ſtir
an Arm. Thus, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> if I ſpeak to you, and underſtand you;
if my Spirit unites itſelf to yours, or my Body to your Body, God alone is
the true cauſe of it, he is the Bond of all the Unions which I am able to
have with all his Works. I can be immediately united to none but him, ſince
none but he can immediately act in me, and I only act through his means.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> I may be united to God, and fix my ſelf
to him, and in that have no relation to any other but him; and I may alſo be
united to God, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome other thing but God: For when I think
on abſtracted Idea's of things, I am united to God by my thought, ſince I
ſee thoſe things only through the means of the Union that I have with God. 
<note n="*" place="margin">Dial. 3.</note> But this Union doth not
bind me to Creatures. On the other ſide, when I feel ſenſible good, it is
only by the Union that I have with God, and becauſe he acts in me: 
<note n="*" place="margin">Dial. 2.</note> For all Bodies are
inſenſible by themſelves; but this ſecond Union which I have with God,
faſtens me to ſenſible things, for God unites among themſelves all his
Works, and he alone can be the Bond of all Unions.</p>
               <p>I therefore believe, that our Union with God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds our Being,
and that we ſhould not exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. But I am perſuaded, that the
Union which faſtens us to none but God, and hath relation to none but him, is
that which gives the utmoſt perfection of which we are capable.</p>

               <p>Do you not remember, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that the Author of the
Book <hi>of the Inquiry after Truth,</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, That our Senſes
never repreſent things to us as they are in themſelves, but only according
to their relation to our ſelves; and that therefore all ſenſible knowledg
is uſeful for the preſervation and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of our liſe, but
altogether unprofitable for the perfection of the Mind, and the knowledg of
Truth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I do remember it, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and ſhall never forget it;
for it was that which perſuaded me, that of all our Knowledg and Notions,
none but thoſe that are purely intellectual make us more perfect; and,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we can be ſaid to ſee in God things as they are only through
thoſe forts of Notions.</p>
               <p>When we have a ſentiment of things, we do not ſee them in
themſelves, we have no knowledg of them, and even in reality they are not the
ſenſible Objects that we do feel, but our very ſelves; for our
Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belong to us, and not to thoſe Objects to which we generally
uſe to attribute them. How then could our Senſes lead us to the knowledg of
Truth, ſince we do not know Truth, but when we ſee things ſuch as they
are?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>If you remember alſo what that Book ſaith of the Errors of our
Imagination and Paſſions, you ought to grant that not only the Imagination
and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hinder us from diſcovering Truth, but alſo that our
Paſſions carry and remove us from the true Good. In a word, that all the
thoughts and motions of the Soul, that excite themſelves in us, by reaſon
of ſome chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that happen in our Body, diſunite us from God, to unite us
to Bodies. For, after all, it is neceſſary that the Soul, who ought to mind
the preſervation of her <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42160:72"/>Body, be warn'd to think on it
when ſome new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happens to it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I grant all theſe things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe then that there never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens any change in
the Brain, but that the Soul receives ſome thought which takes it off from
the light of truth, and the love of true good, and diſunites her from God, to
unite her to Bodies. If it is certain that the perfection of the mind
conſiſts in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of truth, and in the love of true good, in one
word, in an Union with God which hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to none but him, I ask you: In
the ſtate which we are in, wherein we cannot hinder the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
motion, nor the bodies that are about us from penetrating and agitating ours,
what are we to do, to tend continually towards our perfection? do not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Goſpel now, conſult only your reaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is plain that we ought by flight to avoid being acted by
thoſe Bodies that are about us, that we ought to mortify our Senſes, and
keep ſhut as much as we can all the paſſages at which ſenſible
Objects come in, and diſturb our Reaſon.</p>
               <p>When we cannot ſtay the motion of thoſe Bodies that are
capable of offending us, we never fail to ſtep aſide to avoid being
ſtruck by them: Thus, when we are not able to ſtop the action of
ſenſible Objects, we ought to avoid them by flight, in the ſame manner as
we uſe to preſerve our ſelves from contagious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by change of
Air.</p>
               <p>Let an Inſect but prick us, we immediately loſe ſight of the
moſt ſolid truths; let a Fly but buz in our Ears, and our mind will be
preſently fill'd with darkneſs. What ſhall we do then to hold this truth
which ſtill gets away, and preſerve this light which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42160:73"/>from us? Muſt we kill all the Inſects, and drive away
all the Flyes? this can never be. We muſt then remove ſomewhere elſe;
for, after all, it is impoſſible that the Senſations that divide your

               <p>You begin perhaps, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> to diſcover by what
we have ſaid, and by this laſt Anſwer of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that what
Chriſt hath preached about the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our Senſes, is the beſt
method that can be to reunite us to God by the knowledg of Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>It is true: But I am afraid that you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Doctrin of
the Goſpel ſome perfection that Chriſt never deſigned to give it. For,
in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, Chriſt never intended to give us any Precepts to direct
our minds in the inquiry of certain Truths, which are not abſolutely
neceſſary to us in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I own, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that Chriſt's principal deſign
was not to inſtruct us in certain ſpeculative Truths, which do not by
themſelves conduce to the knowledg and love of ſovereign Truth. But the
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel are ſo uſeful, that they extend to all the things
that may in ſome manner add to the perfection of the mind; for they are
direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to the cauſe of our diſorders, and remedy our
diſeaſes in their beginning. And thus they tend to give us all the
perfection whereof we are capable, ſince to deprive our ſelves of
ſenſible things, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a neceſſary thing to help the
converſion of our hearts, but alſo for the perfecting our underſtandings,
as you will ſee it better hereafter.</p>
               <p>Do you think, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that nothing beſides actual
Sentiments can hinder the mind from applying itſelf <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42160:73"/>to
Truth, and that a Man who hath for ſome years enjoyed the pleaſures of the
World is able, when he leaves them, to unite himſelf to intellectual things,
with as much force and light, as thoſe who have du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all their Lives been
careful to purifie their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, certainly, none can enjoy worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with impunity.
When the Imagination hath been touch'd by ſome ſenſible thing, the
impreſſion of it remains; and the enjoyment of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures makes
it eaſily Slaves to them. There remains in our Brain ſome impreſſions
that always repreſent to the mind the pleaſures that it hath enjoy'd, and
that often hinder it from applying itſelf to ſuch things as have no
ſenſible attraction.</p>
               <p>Therefore when the Imagination is ſully'd, the Mind is fill'd
with darkneſs, becauſe Concupiſcence, which of itſelf takes off the
Mind from the ſight of Truth, is ſtrengthned and encreas'd by this new
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence that is acquir'd by the uſe of ſenſible things.</p>

of Truth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>It appears plainly, that we muſt with all imaginable care avoid
whatever is able to make any deep impreſſion in our Brain; we muſt (give
me leave to uſe your expreſſion) ſtrictly take care to purify our
Imaginations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But then, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> we ought not to do Penance; for
painful Senſations as much divide our thinking Faculty as thoſe that are
pleaſing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>A Man ought not to mortify himſelf with an intent to find the
Solution of a Problem, ſuch an <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42160:74"/>Action doth not enlighten
the Mind. None can actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeel Pain, and ſee Truth actually at the
ſame time. But Sufferings, how unuſeful ſoever for the knowledg of
certain Truths, are very uſeful to take us off from ſenſible things; 
<note n="*" place="margin">Pontificius loquitur.</note> to ſatisfy
God's Juſtice, being join'd to thoſe of our Saviour; to merit us the
ſight of that ſovereign Truth which diſſipates all our darkneſs; and
even to teach us ſome certain moral Truths, on which we do not think when we
feel nothing.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> do you not ſee that the
impreſſions of Sufferings that remain in the Memory, do not darken it, like
the impreſſions of Pleaſures? Do you not ſee that they never provoke
Luſt, never diſturb the Mind, never divide its Attention, and that things
being thus, they do not hinder it from diſcovering Truth? We eaſily ceaſe
to think on Pain, as ſoon as we ceaſe to ſuffer it, and have no cauſe
to fear it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pain hath nothing that is pleaſing in itſelf. But
the ſame doth not happen when ever we have taſted of any Pleaſures, their
<hi>veſtiges</hi> or impreſſions remain ſtrongly printed in our Brains,
and do each moment excite ſome troubleſom deſires that diſturb the
peace of the mind; and thoſe deſires renewing thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
Concupiſcence, which is the Spring of all our Ills, and conſequently of the
want of application of the mind to Truth, as well as the corruption of the
heart, inceſſantly receives new ſtrength.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right: But yet we ſee that many learned Men have
ſpent their whole Lives in Debauchery, abandoning themſelves continually to
all ſorts of Pleaſures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Not ſo many as you may think, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> for the
number of the falſe learned is very great. A <pb n="135" facs="tcp:42160:74"/>Man muſt
ſee Truth clearly and diſtinctly, to be truly learned. It is not enough to
have read much; for the Mind knows nothing, if it ſees nothing. Pleaſure,
unleſs it be exceſſive, doth not hinder a Man from reading, none but
violent Pleaſures darken the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and imagination, but the leaſt thing
in the World can darken the ſight of the Mind. The Learned of whom you were
ſpeaking, make more uſe of their memory, and of their imagination, than
they do of their underſtanding; and I every day perceive that thoſe whom
you eſteem moſt for their Learning are a ſort of Men whoſe
underſtanding is ſo ſmall, ſo dark, ſo diſſipated, that they are
not capable of having the leaſt apprehenſion of many Truths which
<hi>Eraſtus</hi> very eaſily comprehends.</p>
               <p>There is much difference between that Learning which depends upon
the largeneſs of the Memory, and the force of the Imagination; and that
Learning which conſiſts in a ſight purely intellectual, wherein the
Imagination hath no ſhare, unleſs it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly.</p>
               <p>All pure Idea's vaniſh, and diſſipate themſelves at the
appearance of ſenſible Idea's. We do not hear the voice of Truth, when our
Senſes and our Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſpeak to us; for we had much rather
confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the relations that things have with us, than clearly to know
what relations they have between themſelves. We are in ſo great a
dependance under Bodies, and ſo little united to God, that the leaſt thing
ſeparates us from him.</p>
               <p>But ſenſible knowledg, and the ſight of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
being ſtrengthned by the <hi>veſtiges</hi> or impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the
Brain, may withſtand contrary Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Idea's of that knowledg have,
if I may <pb n="136" facs="tcp:42160:75"/>uſe that expreſſion, a Body, and cannot be
ſo eaſily diſſipated. Thus Retirement, and a privation from all
Pleaſure, is not abſolutely neceſſary to gain all the knowledg wherein
we make a greater uſe of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Imagination, than of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> came to be ſo learned in
<hi>Geometry, Phyſics,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> it is,
becauſe he paſs'd 25 years in a Retirement; it is becauſe he hath
perfectly diſcover'd the errors of our Senſes, that he hath with care
avoided their impreſſion, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner meditated than read. In a word, it is
becauſe being held by few things, he could unite himſelf to God, in a
manner cloſe enough to receive from him all the neceſſary lights. This
made him extremely learned.</p>
               <p>Had he ſtill diſengag'd himſelf more from his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
leſs immers'd himſelf in the World, and yet more carefully apply'd
himſelf to ſeek after Truth, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he would have carried the
Sciences of which he hath treated much further, and his <hi>Metaphyſics</hi>
would not be ſuch as he hath left them to us in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> now that ſo many able Men have wrote of
<hi>Philoſophy, Mathematics,</hi> and other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, methinks it is enough
if we read their Works. Thoſe learned Perſons whereof I was juſt now
ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, know <hi>Des Cartes</hi> as well as <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
could know himſelf. My Friend whom I have a mind to convert, underſtands
him ſo throughly, that nothing can be mention'd out of that Author but is
known by him; nay, and the very place where it lies: yet he never meditates,
reads a Book in three days, and knows it all. Therefore I judg that Retirement
is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Learning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:42160:75"/>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Not for that Learning which reſides in Memory, and doth not
enlighten the Mind. Do you think that thoſe Perſons who ſo eaſily
remember other Mens Opinions, can ſee the truth of them? Do you think that
your Friend knows <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or rather do you think that he ſees
what <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſaw? If you do, you are much miſtaken. I will
grant to you, that your Friend knows all the words which <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
hath us'd, better than <hi>Des Cartes</hi> himſelf did; or that he can better
relate <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Opinion, than <hi>Des Cartes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could
have done it. In ſhort, I will believe, if you will, that he is fitter to
make a Man a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> to enlighten the minds of thoſe that hear
him, and make them receive <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Sentiments, than <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> himſelf was: yet, for all this, I do not believe that he truly
knows <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is in his memory and
imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for that Reaſon he ſpeaks pertinently of it: but I do not
believe that it is in his mind, and for that Reaſon he neither ſees nor
approves thoſe Sentiments that are the neceſſary Conſequences of
it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems as a Paradox, that a Man who doth not know a Truth,
ſhould ſometimes be more capable of perſuading another of it, than he who
exactly knows it, and diſcover'd it himſelf; yet if you conſider that we
inſtruct others only by Words, you will eaſily perceive that thoſe that
have any force of imagination, and a happy memory, often can, remembring what
they have read, explain themſelves more clearly, than thoſe who are
accuſtom'd to meditation, and who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Truth by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> do not imagin that thoſe who
ſpeak pertinently to you concerning ſome certain Truths, ſee them
perfectly, for it is not always ſo: <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42160:76"/>many times this
happens, yet thoſe Truths are only in their memory, or elſe they ſee them
by an imaginary ſight, for that ſight furniſhes expreſſions lively,
and that ſeem to ſignify much, tho' they ſignify nothing diſtinct, only
to thoſe whom they move to retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is much difference between ſeeing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; between
ſeeing after having read, and ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having meditated: And to find
out thoſe that ſee diſtinctly and perfectly poſſeſs a Truth, from
thoſe who do not poſſeſs it, there needs truly to propoſe to them
ſome queſtion that depends from it; for then thoſe that ſee clearly
ſpeak clearly, but the others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeak in ſuch a manner as
diſcovers their want of light.</p>
               <p>Examin your learned Men, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> according to this
method, and you will find that the moſt learned are the moſt ignorant; that
they have the leſs pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and the greateſt raſhneſs; that they
cannot ſo much as diſcern Truth from what ſeems to be ſuch; that they
ſpeak without conceiving what they ſay; and that often in the very
inſtant that you admire them, what is moſt to be admired in them, is
nothing but an effect of that memory which, like a Watch, goes of itſelf, and
whoſe ſprings unbend themſelves by the action of the imagination.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, you will ſee after all, that almoſt all their
knowledg is deſtitute of light and evidence, of that intellectual light and
evidence that is darkned by the ſlighteſt ſenſation, and diſſipated
by the ſmalleſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that therefore Retirement, a privation of
ſenſible things, the mortification of the ſenſes and paſſions are
abſolutely neceſſary for the perfection of the underſtanding, as alſo
for the converſion of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42160:76"/>But this doth not juſtify the Morals of the
Goſpel, for Chriſt did not come to teach us the <hi>Mathematics,
Philoſophy,</hi> and ſuch other Truths, which by themſelves are
unuſeful enough for our Salvation.</p>
               <p>All knowledg of Truth rendring the mind in ſome manner more
perfect, it was neceſſary that Chriſt's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſhould be proper to
purchaſe it. But the true perfection of the mind, and the ſhorteſt way to
learn generally all Sciences, being an Union with God (not the natural Union,
which is inceſſantly interrupted by the motions of Concupiſcence, but the
Union which a clear ſight, and a continual love make indiſſolvable,) It
was neceſſary that Chriſt's Precepts ſhould put us in the way, whereby
we may attain to that Union.</p>
               <p>You will ſee at our next Interview, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion alone can lead us to it. In the mean time I leave you with
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> to meditate on the things which we have ſaid now.</p>

               <p>Yes, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> I am convinc'd. Truth in itſelf appears
ſo mean a thing to Men toſs'd with Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or join'd to ſome
ſenſible Object, that they can't but deſpiſe it; and tho' there are
many that ſeek after it, 'tis, I confeſs, out of deſign, and hope to draw
ſome advantage from it. The brightneſs and glory which environs the
Learned, ſparkles and dazles us, our ſecret <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42160:77"/>Pride
awakes and ſtirs us up: But the pure light of Truth is not lively enough to
make us perceive it, when we are preingaged with other things.</p>

               <p>I have known ſome Men, who probably read in the Morning, for a
matter of Talk in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; for as ſoon as they had left the little
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that applauded them, they have had ſuch an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for Books, and
every thing call'd Learning, that they cou'd not abide to hear it ſpoke of.
You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Mr. <hi>F.</hi> for three years, he doubtleſs took great
pleaſure to teach three or four of us young Men who came to hear him, ſince
he wou'd fatigue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf every Morning, to repeat the miſerable Reaſons
which he plunder'd out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Problems. Now he reads no
more; for we hearing him no longer with admiration, he ſpeaks no more with
pleaſure. He even has much averſion for all Diſcourſes of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and as he is a little troubleſom, we have found out the ſecret to get rid
of his Company, by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome Queſtion to him to have it
reſolv'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>This Example, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> was not needful to convince us
that Perſons who are wedded to ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing, do not ſearch
after Truth for its ſake. You ſee that we are well enough convinc'd of it.
You may obſerve the weakneſs of other Men, and how their Vanity renders 'em
miſerable, provided that you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelf in their perſon, for
we are all very near one as the other. But, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> we never ought
to inſpire into any one a Contempt of, or Eſtrangement from a Perſon,
unleſs we are certain, I ſay certain, that he is dangerous and contagious.
Otherwiſe we muſt ſpeak in general terms. You would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by your
judicious Reflection, give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that you are witty; we already
know it, <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42160:78"/>but we knew not that you would have it known.
'Tis a hard thing to accuſe others of Vanity, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning one's
ſelf of the ſame thing, or ſomething elſe equivalent. Thus,
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> you may conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, continually criticize, but
think and correct your ſelf, and if you would not condemn your ſelf, hold
your peace.</p>
               <p>You freely grant, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> that the Councels of
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> are neceſſary to acquire that perfection of the
Mind which conſiſts in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Truth. Nevertheleſs <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST</hi> came not to make us Philoſophers, his Councels, as I told you
yeſterday, tend only indirectly, and by reaſon of their univerſality to
make us wiſe. But if he gave not to his Diſciples many Precepts of Logic to
reaſon juſtly, yet he taught them all neceſſary Rules to live well, and
gave them alſo all neceſſary power to follow them. 'Tis for this end that
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> is come, his deſign is to remedy the diſorder of
Sin, to reunite us to God, by ſeparating us from the Body, to ſave us, and
raiſe us up to himſelf in Heaven.</p>
               <p>We ſhall eternally remain ſuch, as we ſhall be in the moment
that our Soul ſhall leave our Body. If we love God in this moment, we ſhall
love him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; for the motion of Spirits is only unconſtant, and
meritorious for this life: But all human Sciences are in themſelves
unprofitable, to regulate this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which depends our Eternity; they
merit us not the Aſſiſtances of Heaven for this moment, they incline not
our hearts towards God. Thus <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> was not to guide us
directly to this perfection of the Mind which is barren for Eternity, and which
ceaſes at the moment of Death; he was to recommend to us a privation from
ſenſible Good, to the end <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42160:78"/>that our hearts may be
fill'd with his love, being empty of every thing elſe; and to the end that
adhering to nothing in the moment that commences Eternity, our love may carry
us towards God who is the ſource of all happineſs.</p>
               <p>Let us not then any more conſider the Councels of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST,</hi> with reſpect to the knowledg of Truth, but with reſpect to
this perfection of Mind, which conſiſts in the love of real Good, in
Charity which remains for ever, which alone merits Eternity, and without which
all Virtues are but imaginary.</p>
               <p>Let us examin the Morality of the Goſpel with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the
Rule of Manners, but let us examin it with all poſſible ſtrictneſs,
that there may be no Subject for a ſecond Enquiry; let us not be convinc'd
leſs of our Duties by Reaſon, than we are by Faith.</p>
               <p>Certainly if the things which I have prov'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> in the preceding Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are true, there remains
no doubt about the truths of Morality; we muſt renounce our own Wills, we
muſt bear his Croſs, we muſt weep, faſt and ſuffer. <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST</hi> hath ſaid it. If he is God, if he is Wiſe, 'tis evident that
his Councels are very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to us. But becauſe we can't be too much
convinc'd of the truth of theſe Propoſitions, which are ſo incommodious,
and which offend us ſo ſenſibly, we muſt endeavor to diſcover by our
own Reaſon that there is no other remedy for our Evils.</p>
               <p>Perhaps we ſhall do like thoſe that are dangerouſly hurt,
who, to preſerve a miſerable life, preſent their own Bodies to the
Surgeons to be cut and burnt; they believe theſe Men upon their word, and
confide in their Operations, and expoſe themſelves to a great pain, in an
uncertain proſpect of a Good which in itſelf <pb n="144" facs="tcp:42160:79"/>is very
inconſiderable: What then ſhould hinder us from imitating them, when the
evidence of Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with the certainty of Faith? If we refuſe to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> if we fear not Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if we hearken to
out Senſes and Paſſions, yet it may be, that Reaſon join'd to Faith,
will effect our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: And it may be that, by continually condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our
lazineſs, it will excite in us a profitable Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Let us therefore
examin thoſe things in their Principle.</p>
               <p>We ought only to love what is lovely. No Thing is lovely but what
is good; but no Thing is good with reſpect to us, if it be uncapable of doing
us good, if it be uncapable of rendring us more perfect and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py (for I
ſpeak not here of a kind of Good which conſiſts in the perfection of
every thing.) Now no Thing is capable of rendring us more perfect and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
if it be not above us, and capable of acting in us. But all Bodies are below
us, they can't act in us, they can't produce in us either pleaſure or light,
then they are not to be belov'd: What think you <hi>Eraſtus?</hi>

diſtinctly than my Senſes, as it is preferable to my Senſes, and as it
never deceives me, tho' my Senſes always do, when I make uſe of them to
judge of Truth; I believe that ſenſible Objects are uncapable of rendring
me more perfect and happy.</p>

there only remains in human appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion a violent Remedy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>When <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> perceived himſelf, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the
pleaſure of the Chace, he ſhould have forthwith left it; He ſhould
reſemble me, his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhould not be filled with theſe Veſtiges,
which continually renew the object of his Paſſion; 'tis the Pleaſure that
is found in the uſe of ſenſible things which is the Cauſe of
Paſſions, and which agitates the animal Spirits; but when the animal
Spirits are ſtrongly agitated, they impreſs deep Veſtiges in the Brain,
they even break, thro' their violent Courſe, all the Fibres which reſiſt
them: Thus as ſoon as we taſte pleaſure we muſt examine and ſee if it
be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the Veſtiges of the Object which cauſe this
pleaſure perfect their form; if the Object which cauſes this pleaſure is
unworthy of our Application and Love, we muſt deprive our ſelves of it, and
alſo ſhun the pleaſure which enſlaves us by the Veſtiges it 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42160:80"/>impreſſes in our Brain. 'Tis this I believe which we
ought to do to hinder our Concupiſcence from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual growth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>—But <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> when you actually taſte of
pleaſure, can you eaſily quit the Object that cauſes it? When
<hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> was in the heat of the Chaſe, the firſt time he went
thither, do you think he was in a Condition to reflect upon himſelf? Did not
the Sound of the Horn, the Noiſe and running of the Dogs, the motion of the
Horſe, and above all this the pleaſure that he found in all theſe
different motions, take up his mind? Did not his Paſſion carry him as well
as his Horſe, to the Death of the Hare or Stag? And do you believe that he
could then think of your Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Or if he had thought, do you believe that he
would have been willing to have made uſe of it? Or that he could have
reſiſted the Paſſion which agitated him? The Philoſophical Remedies
which you have laid down, are not proper at ſuch a time, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>
to hinder our Concupiſcence that it ſhould not encreaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true <hi>Theodorus,</hi> the moſt certain of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
is that of privation. Pleaſure poyſons us, we muſt not taſte it, this
the moſt ſhort and ſure Rule (b) <hi>He that commits Sin becomes the
Slave of it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 8.34</note> I find that reaſon
perfectly agrees with the Goſpel, nevertheleſs I remember that I have cured
my Imagination and reſiſted my Paſſion by the uſe of things, which,
according to what you have ſaid, ſhould encreaſe it. Thus,</p>
               <p>About three or four years ago, I freely believed every thing that
I heard: One day there came an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer hither who ſaid, that travelling with
an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> that could not forbear ſmoking, it hapned that this
<hi>Engliſhmans</hi> Horſe fell down, and broke his Maſters 
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42160:81"/>Leg, who being upon the ground, and thinking rather on his
Pipe than Leg, he put his hand into his Pocket, and taking out his Pipe whole,
he cry'd out with Joy, <hi>Well, well, my Pipe is not broke.</hi> This Relation
ſtruck me, and I imagin'd the ſmoke of Tobacco was the moſt agreeable
thing in the World, ſo that I perceiv'd my ſelf urg'd with a violent
Paſſion to try it; but it happen'd to me as to many others, that I had no
ſooner taſted it, but had a horror for it. Thus, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> your
Remedy, which is to deprive us of ſenſible things, is not general; for the
uſe of Tobacco has cured me of the Paſſion I had for it, and when I had
not us'd it, I was deſirous of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> don't you ſee that we muſt be
depriv'd of all that is capable of ſullying the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? The Commerce we
have with thoſe who ſpeak of Bodies as true Goods, is capable of
impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing traces in the Brain which carry us to the love of Bodies, as
well as the very uſe of Bodies. A Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, who ſpeaks of Wine as of his
God, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thoſe who know not how to drink, and who places
amongſt his braveſt Actions the Victories which he hath got at the Table
againſt the greateſt Debauchees of the Province, ſuch a Drunkard, in his
gay humor eaſily perſuades a young Man that 'tis a fine quality to drink as
much Wine as two Horſes can drink Water. 'Tis for this that in all places
where Men ſpeak of drinking much, as of a Vertue, all the World drinks to
exceſs; for even thoſe who don't at firſt delight in drinking, doing as
others, to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subject of their Companions Ralleries, they are by
degrees ſo accuſtom'd to Wine, that they can't be without it.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> as Concupiſcence does principally
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <pb n="149" facs="tcp:42160:81"/>in the traces of the Brain, which incline the
Soul to the love of ſenſible things, it muſt be depriv'd of all things
which produce theſe traces, not only of the actual uſe of Bodies, which is
of no uſe to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of health and life, but alſo of the
Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Debauchees, who ſpeak with eſteem of the objects of
their paſſions.</p>
               <p>'Tis pleaſure, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> which agitates the Spirits,
and which produces dangerous traces, not only that which we enjoy by our
Senſes, but that alſo which we enjoy by Imagination; not only the taſte,
but, alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. And ſometimes the Imagination does ſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
all things, that the pleaſure it produces excites the Concupiſcence after a
more ſtrong and lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than that we enjoy even in the uſe of
Bodies.</p>
               <p>Perſons who have too quick and delicate an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, may
ſometimes cure the hurt they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a contagious diſcourſe, by
taſting the pleaſures which are repreſented to them, or of which they
form'd themſelves too great an Idea. And there are certain baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, lazy
and judicious perſons, and of a certain diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind hard to
deſcribe, to whom it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſometimes to ſhew the world, to give
'em a diſlike of it.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> this is rare, and 'tis extremely
dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be familiariz'd with ſenſible things. You have an horror for
Tobacco, you are pleas'd not to be ſubject to the neceſſity of always
having ſome with you; yet if you were to be with Men who frequently uſe it,
their diſcourſe and manner would engage you by degrees to uſe it your
ſelf, and Uſe would ſubject you to it as well as others; for I know
ſome who can't be without it, that could not endure it heretofore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Erast.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that the great Secret to
reſiſt Concupiſcence, is to have continually an eye to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42160:82"/>of our Imagination, and to take heed that it leave not
footſteps in the Brain, which may carry us to the love of ſenſible
things, thus to remedy the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Irregularities. The Councels of
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> which only tend to deprive us of the uſe of
ſenſible things are admirable, but they are very uneaſie; methinks
Philoſophy furniſhes us with a Remedy more commodious than that of the
Goſpel, 'tis this:</p>
               <p>Philoſophy teaches me, that all Bodies which are about me can't
act in me, and that 'tis God only that cauſes in me the pleaſure and grief
which I feel in their uſe; this being granted, I can enjoy Bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
loving them: for as I only ought to love that which is truly capable of making
me happy, to excite in me the love of God, I have only to remember in the uſe
of ſenſible things, that 'tis God who makes me happy by their means. Thus I
ought not to ſhun Bodies, on the contrary I ought to ſeek them; that ſo
by exciting pleaſure in me, they may continually make me to think of God who
is the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Whence comes it that the Bleſſed love God conſtantly, and
that they can't leave off loving him, if it is not that they ſee him, and
that they are ty'd to him by a preingaging pleaſure? Well then, I ſee God
by Philoſophy, I perceive him in every thing; if I eat, I think of God,
becauſe 'tis God that makes me eat with pleaſure; I'm not careful to love
good entertainment, as there's nothing but God which acts in me, I only love
him.</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> are free from ſin, and confirm'd in
grace, for who ſhall diſunite you from God? the moſt violent pleaſures
tie you more ſtrongly to him, and pains can only produce in you a fear and
reſpect for him; but do you your ſelf often make uſe of your 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42160:82"/>own Remedy, and have you never acted contrary to the
remorſe of your Conſcience?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Erast.</speaker>
               <p>I am very ſenſible, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of
my Philoſophy is not ſoveraign, but pray ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to us the defects of
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I will: When you taſte of Fruit with pleaſure, your Reaſon
tells you that there is a God whom you ſee not, who cauſes in you this
pleaſure; your Senſes tell you on the contrary, that this Fruit which you
ſee, which you hold in your hands,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which you eat, is that which
cauſes in you this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; which of theſe two ſpeaks higher, your
Reaſon or your Senſes? As for me, I find that the noiſe of my Senſes is
ſo great, that I even think no of God in that moment; but perhaps
<hi>Eraſtus</hi> is ſuch a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that his Senſes are ſilent
as ſoon as he pleaſes, and that they never ſpeak to him without firſt
obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Licence. If ſo, your Remedy is good for you; for the privation
of Bodies is not abſolutely neceſſary to thoſe who have no
Concupiſcence. <hi>Adam</hi> could taſte of pleaſures without becoming
their Slave, tho he had done better to have let them alone.</p>
               <p>Then let thoſe who feel no Concupiſcence in them, and whoſe
Body is intirely ſubject to the Spirit, make uſe of your Remedy, 'tis good
for them: they are juſt by themſelves, they deſcend in a right Line from
the <hi>Pre-Adamites.</hi> Neither did Chriſt come for them, he came not to
ſave the Juſt, but Sinners. He came for us who are Sinners, Children of a
ſinful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſold, and ſubject to Sin, and who always feel in our
Bodies the Rebellion of our Senſes and Paſſions.</p>
               <p>When the obligation we have to preſerve our health and life
conſtrains us to enjoy ſome pleaſure, then we <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42160:83"/>muſt
make a neceſſity of Virtue, and make uſe of your Remedy if we can,
remembring that theſe are not the Objects which cauſe in us this
pleaſure, but God only, we muſt thank him for them, and pray to him that he
would defend us from the malignity of ſenſible Objects, we muſt uſe
them with fear, and with a kind of horror; for without the grace of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST,</hi> that which gives life to the Body, gives death to the Soul, you
know the Reaſons of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Erast.</speaker>
               <p>But why? Pleaſure in itſelf is not ill, I receive it, then it
does me no harm, I thank God for it, and love him the more; it unites me to
God, who is the Author of it, then it does me good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>The love of God, which the enjoyment of Pleaſure cauſes in you
is much intereſted; I'm much afraid, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that in loving God
as the Author of your Pleaſure, you love your ſelf inſtead of loving God.
But I wiſh that this love be not ill, I alſo wiſh that you have the power
of raiſing your ſelf up to God, in the time that you enjoy ſome
Pleaſure, but this Pleaſure makes traces in the Brain, theſe traces
continually agitate the Soul, and in the time of Prayer, or ſome other
neceſſary buſineſs, they diſturb the Action, blind the Mind, and
ſtir up the Paſſions. Thus when you would even make a good uſe of
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, at the moment that you ſhould taſte it, the trouble that it
diſperſes thro' the Imagination, has ſo dangerous Conſequences, that
you had better have been depriv'd of it.</p>
               <p>Think you, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that there has been a Race of
Mankind ſo very ſtupid, as to get drunk for the honor of God, and to bring
him into one's mind for the pleaſure of drunkenneſs; and do you obſerve,
that the pleaſure which is found in the exceſſive uſe of 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42160:83"/>ſenſible things, is ſuch as can't be pray'd for to
God without remorſe. Hence it is, that this pleaſure was not ordain'd by
Nature to carry us directly to God, but for the uſe of Bodies, ſo far as
they ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of life.</p>
               <p>We muſt love God, becauſe Reaſon informs us, that every
thing is center'd in him that deſerves our love. God will be lov'd with a
clear love, with a love which flows from pure light, and not with a confus'd
Sentiment ſuch as Pleaſure is. God is ſo lovely, that thoſe who ſee
him as he is, would love him in the midſt of the moſt cruel Torments; and
we do not love him as he deſerves, when we love him becauſe 'tis he only
who can create agreeable Sentiments in us.</p>
               <p>A Friend reproves us, becauſe he ſhould do it; we offend our
ſelves, when we puniſh our ſelves for our Irregularities, do we therefore
ceaſe to love our ſelves or our Friend? No, doubtleſs, we endeavor,
perhaps, to ſhun the Reproof which our Friend thinks himſelf oblig'd to
give us; but if we ſee that he only does what he ought to do, we are
unreaſonable, if we ceaſe to have an intrinſic reſpect and love for
him.</p>
               <p>If then a perſon could conceive that God ows that to his
Juſtice, which he inflicts upon him to make him ſenſible of the higheſt
pains, he always would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer patiently, without ceaſing to love God. He
ſhould not love theſe pains in themſelves, but he ſhould love the
Author of them, who, if he did not inflict them, would be leſs lovely,
becauſe he would be leſs juſt, and leſs perfect.</p>
               <p>A Criminal who hath brib'd his Judge, loves and eſteems him much
leſs than if he had puniſht him; provided that this Criminal, who is not
juſt enough to hate the Crime in himſelf, would be reaſonable enough 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42160:84"/>to hate it in another. Accordingly the bleſſed might
ſuffer the pains of the damned, without hating God; for altho' the pleaſure
they enjoy keeps them united to God inſeparably, yet they love not God for
the ſake of the pleaſure which they receive from him, they would even love
him in their Torments: For, after all, pleaſure is not ſo much inſtituted
to make us love the Author of it, as to unite us to him, ſince, as
reaſonable Creatures, Reaſon alone ought to ſtir up our love.</p>
               <p>Pleaſure ſhould carry us to the cauſe of it, and true Good
ſhould be capable of producing it, becauſe true Good ſhould recompence
all thoſe who truly love: But pleaſure, which is the recompence and
attraction of the love of the Iuſt, is not their end, for the Juſt would
then love themſelves inſtead of their good. God deſerves love in
himſelf, and the pleaſure which is found in the uſe of Bodies, inſtead
of inviting, is to love him as we ought to do, and even the ſweetneſs which
is taſted in love, ſets us at a diſtance from him, if reſting upon this
ſweetneſs we love him not for himſelf, for then we love our ſelves
inſtead of him.</p>

               <p>I obſerve that there's nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than to make
uſe of ſenſible pleaſures, and I am am now convinc'd that they
increaſe Concupiſcence, by the impreſſions which they make in the
Brains, and carry the mind not to God, who is their Author, but to Bodies which
ſeem to produce them, and that tho' (abſolutely ſpeaking) they may induce
us to think of God who is their Author, yet they excite in us nothing but an
intereſted love, a love which is more like Self-love, than true Charity.</p>

               <p>But, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> the Law of Nature does not only oblige us
to love God, but alſo Men; and if we <pb n="155" facs="tcp:42160:84"/>have not ſome
Correſpondence with them by means of the Body, what other Reaſon will
induce us to love them? 'Tis Intereſt which forms Societies. 'Tis Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
which unites different Sexes; and there are whole Nations that can't maintain
Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce but by the means of Wine. To drink toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is
ſufficient to put away Enmity amongſt ſome Men. A glaſs of Wine muſt
be drunk to drive on a Bargain. Thus you ſee it is profitable for Men to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Pleaſure together, to preſerve that Union and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt

               <p>I believe you have a mind to make your ſelf merry,
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> What! do you believe that there's any thing beſides
Truth and Juſtice, which can ſtrictly unite us together? do you believe
that a Peace concluded in drink betwixt Drunkards, would be ſo ſolid as
that which reaſonable Men make in the ſight of Juſtice, and by a Motive
of Charity? Certainly all the Bonds which are made by Intereſt, are
unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable towards the fulfilling of the Precept of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Neighbor.
The Appearances are ſav'd, and Men are treated with Civility, but cordial
Love is wanting, when Intereſt lies at the ſtake. We muſt love other Men
for God; for as it is he that ſhould termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate all the motions of our heart,
he can only reunite all minds in himſelf. But the Commerce which we may have
with Men by means of the Body, are only proper to create a diviſion amongſt
us; for ſenſible Goods are not like thoſe of the mind, one can't
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them without ſharing them. It's enough for a Man to deſire
an enjoyment of his Friend's Eſtate, to make him unhappy and become his
Enemy. It's the Love of temporal advantage which begets Wars, and breeds
Diviſion in Families. Perſons would enjoy theſe <pb n="156" facs="tcp:42160:85"/>Goods, but can't, without depriving thoſe of them that poſſeſs
them. Thus 'tis evident, that a contempt of ſenſible Goods, and a privation
of Pleaſures, are as uſeful for the preſervation of Peace amongſt them
as to continue a ſtrict Union with God.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that to avoid a quarrel with any
Body, there's no better means than to yield our Poſſeſſions to thoſe
that deſire them of us, but the Command of Jeſus Chriſt in this matter is
very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and I do not ſee that even the moſt perfect follow
it.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I confeſs it, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> there are many
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions on which we ſhould not too rigidly purſue this Command, but we
muſt always be diſpoſed to it if there be neceſſity. 'Tis not the
difficulty that we find in this Command, and in the reſt, which ought to
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from practiſing them; on the contrary, they are ſo much the more
uſeful, as they tend more to ſatisfy the 
<note n="*" place="margin">Pontificius loquitur.</note> Juſtice of
God, and to merit the Favor of our perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union with him.</p>
               <p>We are all Sinners, and deſerve to ſuffer; and theſe
inſtructions of Privation being painful, they have this advantage, that they
cleanſe us from our Sins, in making us partakers in the Sufferings of
<hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our miſery we have all of us need of the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of
Heaven, but <hi>CHRIST</hi> teaches us to merit them, when our Sufferings being
join'd to his, our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are meritorious with his. Thus the
Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency you find in the Precepts of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> bring their
Recommendation along with them.</p>
               <p>If the trouble which attends the privation of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Objects were not neceſſary to ſatisfy God, nor <pb n="157" facs="tcp:42160:85"/>merit
his Aſſiſtance, of which we have the greateſt need, I confeſs there
would be a fault in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic Councils; nevertheleſs there would be none
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the Reaſons I have produc'd. But theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions do ſo
perfectly and univerſally remedy all our Evils, they are ſo proportion'd to
the Condition which Sin has reduc'd us to, that if we cannot follow them, we
can't yet forbear to admire them.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, the Inſtructions of <hi>CHRIST</hi> do perfectly
remedy Concupiſcence, but 'tis provided we follow them. We can do only
thoſe things which we would do, and we are commanded to do what we would not;
for 'tis pleaſure that makes us willing, and the Goſpel forbids it; Who
then ſhall be able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe Inſtructions? I am much afraid that
<hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>'s Friend will ſay, That Chriſtian Morality
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles <hi>Plato</hi>'s Politicks; that 'tis beautiful in its
<hi>Idea,</hi> but has this eſſential fault, which renders it wholly
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, that Men are incapable of it.</p>

               <p>It's neceſſary, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that Chriſtianity
ſhould be ſuch as it is to be perfect, you agree with me in this, but ſay
it's impoſsible to follow it. Yes, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> 'tis ſo without
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> but with him all things are poſsible. He is our Strength, as
well as our Wiſdom. If he counſels us to act contrary to our Wills, 'tis
becauſe he is able to change our hearts. He is not like <hi>Plato,</hi> who
gives Laws to eſtabliſh a Republic, but does not make Men capable of
obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Laws. <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath eſtabliſh'd the moſt
perfect Morality that can be, and at the ſame time gives Men a power to act
agreeably; he regenerates them, and ſtrips them of the Old Man; he gives them
a heart of fleſh, in which he writes thoſe Laws which the <hi>Jews</hi>
receiv'd from <hi>Moſes</hi> written in <pb n="158" facs="tcp:42160:86"/>Stone; Faith and
Experience teaches us theſe things.</p>
               <p>The Republic of <hi>Plato</hi> is a Republic in <hi>Idea,</hi> it
is not made up of Men; but how many Chriſtians, even in a ſtrict Senſe,
purſue the Counſels of their Maſter? How many Religious Saints
continually mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their Senſes and Paſsions, and labour with all their
Might to deſtroy the Body of Sin, this Old Man, whoſe deſires diſturb
their peace and hopes?</p>
               <p>It's neceſſary, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that the power of God
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the execution of the Precepts of Morality, that we may not doubt of
the truth of Religion. It's neceſſary that there be nothing <hi>humane</hi>
in the Religion which God eſtabliſhes, to the end that it attribute
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its eſtabliſhment to the Politics of Princes; the inclination
of Men, and the natural diſpoſition of their minds.</p>
               <p>The Precepts of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> tho' painful in themſelves, yet
being followed, juſtify Religion; and known Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion makes men obedient to
his Precepts. He in whom we believe enables us to act as we act, and what we
thus act is ſo much above our power, that it makes us believe what we
believe. Thus the Precepts of <hi>CHRIST</hi> far from being unprofitable,
becauſe they appear difficult and uneaſy to us, ought to be eſteem'd by
us wholly Divine, ſince he that is wiſe enough to give them to us, is
alſo powerful enough to aſsiſt us. We ſhall ſpeak ſomething the
next Meeting of this power by which we are enabled to fulfil the Precepts of
the Goſpel. Pray, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> think of it with your Friend, ſo that
our next Diſcourſe may be the more ſatisfactory.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Arist.</speaker>
               <p>I Have thought on thoſe things you ſaid to us yeſterday,
<hi>Theodorus,</hi> and on thoſe whereof we are to treat this day. I am
convinc'd of the firſt, and I will tell you what I think of the others.</p>
               <p>I look upon Man as being between Heaven and Earth, between the
place of his Reſt and Felicity, and that of his Troubles and Miſeries;
faſten'd to God, yet knowing him not; faſten'd to Bodies, which he ſees.
Seeing that pleaſure moves and tranſports him, and that, whilſt he enjoys
it, he doth not ſee Him who is the true cauſe of it in the ſame manner as
he ſees and feels the Bodies that are the occaſion of it, he runs with Fury
after Bodies, and doth not ſo much as think on God. So it is neceſſary
that he deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſenſible pleaſures, if he will ſtop the
motion that draws him out of the way to Heaven, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him towards
earthly things; this is plain; but a privation of pleaſure is not yet
ſufficient to raiſe him towards Heaven.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> a Balance, one of whoſe
Scales is empty, and the other heavily laden; <pb n="160" facs="tcp:42160:87"/>tho by
little and little you take out of the Scale what was in it, till there remain
almoſt nothing in it, notwithſtanding all this, there will be no alteration
in the Balance: For this you muſt altogether empty it, or lay ſomething of
weight in the other Scale, that may poize it equally.</p>
               <p>Now our Mind is like a Balance; nor is it perfectly free in one
ſenſe, but when the weight that tranſports and captivates it, is equal
for Heaven and Earth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when there is no weight of either ſide: For
then the Mind being as it were <hi>in Aequilibrio,</hi> eaſily moves of
itſelf towards that which by reaſon it finds to be its true good. It is not
mov'd nor determin'd by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaging pleaſure, but by reaſon alone; its
ſenſes have no ſhare in the Act; it's love is an underſtanding love,
and altogether worthy of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> before his Fall, having no Concupiſcence, his
Senſes and his Paſſions yielding to him as ſoon as he deſir'd it, in
ſhort, being not drawn in ſpite of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the love of ſenſible
things, by involontary and rebellious preingaging pleaſures, he was perfectly
free, and ſtood in no want of that kind of Grace which conſiſts in a
preingaging delectation; becauſe the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance was not ſway'd on either
ſide by any weight.</p>
               <p>But now that one of the Cups of the Balance is extremely loaded,
we cannot be free in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the firſt Man; for even the moſt
Righteous Perſons cannot entirely free themſelves of the weight of
Concupiſcence. All they can do, is to leſſen the weight by retirement, by
a privation of pleaſures, and a continual mortification of their Senſes and
Paſſions. But not being able to bring that weight to nothing, they ſtand
in need of the delectation of Grace to counterpoize it, and put the Scale in a
perfect <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:42160:87"/>I therefore believe <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that
for us to deny our ſelves the Pleaſures of this World, is not ſufficient
to deliver us wholly from being Slaves to them, but that in order to this we
ſtand in abſolute need of Chriſt's 
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note,</hi> By Chriſt's Grace, is
here meant that which he has particularly merited us, which conſiſts for in
a preingaging delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in a loathing which he cauſes us to have for
falſe good: For the Graces of Light and Joy which Chriſt hat halſo
merited for us, are common to us with the Firſt Man, who, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no
Concupiſcence, had no need of preingaging Pleaſures, as we have explained
it in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Dialogue.</note> Grace. But as a ſmall Weight is able to
make a pair of Scales even, when one of them has very little in it, 'tis plain
that a leſſening of the weight of Sin, or a denying ones ſelf the uſe
of Worldly Pleaſure, is the beſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order to receive, not only
Grace, but even the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Grace (provided this Self denyal be an effect
of the dictates of God's Spirit.) For 'tis evident that the efficacy of Grace
commonly depends on the diſpoſition which we are in, with reſpect to
Worldly things, as a Weights acting in a pair of Scales depends, as to its
effect, on the force of the contrary Weights.</p>
               <p>As every Weight preſſes downward, ſo in one ſence every
Grace is efficacious, or draws us towards God; but as every Weight does not
make the Scales even, nor turns them when another Weight hinders it, ſo every
Grace does not ſet us wholly free, nor does it force us towards God. So that
every Grace may be ſaid to be efficacious, though it turn not a Heart
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and every Grace is ſufficient to do this, when we are well
prepar'd to receive it; for there is no Weight, how ſmall ſoever it may be,
but what may ſet a pair of Scales even, when the obſtacle is very
light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42160:88"/>Thus the efficacy and ſufficiency of Grace
may be conſider'd in themſelves, or relatively: If we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them in
themſelves, any Grace will appear to be efficacious, and conſequently
ſufficient; if rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, we ſhall find it ſometimes efficacious and
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and ſometimes not. Yet not but that God may beſtow on a
Sinner ſome Graces whoſe efficacy all the malignity of Sin could never
hinder; for though we ſuppoſe a Ballance to be extreamly fill'd on one
ſide, there may yet be found a Weight great enough to make it even.</p>
               <p>This is what came into my Mind upon the ſubject matter of our
Conference.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Your Reflections are Juſt; but your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon does not ſay
enough yet. Pray, <hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> what do you mean by this word
<hi>Grace?</hi> 'Tis a looſe and undetermin'd expreſſion which, like
ſome words uſed by Logicians, can give no diſtinct Idea of any thing,
principally to ſuch a one as <hi>Eraſtus.</hi> Do you underſtand by this
word barely preingaging De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>Hitherto I only meant this kind of Delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But by the word
<hi>Grace,</hi> we may underſtand whatever is capable of making the Scales
even, and of drawing the Mind towards God, or of fixing it ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him,
if it be united to him already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>All this is ſtill very general. Pray tell me <hi>Eraſtus,</hi>
do you know what are the things that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of drawing us towards God,
and of fixing us ſtrongly to him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſtus,</speaker>
               <p>I do not know them all in particular; but it ſeems to me in
general, that only Light and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure make us love him, and that, beſides
Light and Pleaſure, Joy may confirm our Love, though it never 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42160:88"/>begins it; ſince, when I examine my ſelf, I know no
other motive of my particular will. If I begin to love any thing, it is either
becauſe I know, or feel that this thing is good for me; and if I continue to
love it, 'tis becauſe I continue to know or feel that this thing is good for
me; or elſe it is that I rejoyce at the ſight or taſte of the good that I
poſſeſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> all the Graces of which you have an
Idea, which carry you towards good, are either Graces of Light which enlighten
the Mind without determining it, or Graces of preingaging Pleaſure which
determine the Mind without enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, or Graces of Joy which follow the
Light and Determination of the Mind, and only ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it in its
choice. You do not ſpeak of being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of falſe good, or ween'd from
it, nor do you ſpeak of the Loathing which we come to have of it, nor of the
ſorrow we conceive at the ſight of our miſery when we rejoyce in this
falſe good. But I plainly ſee the Reaſon of it: 'Tis that theſe ſorts
of Graces do not by themſelves carry us towards our true good, though they
are often neceſſary that the Graces which by themſelves carry towards
that true good may act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>This is true, <hi>Theodorus.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> what think you of the neceſſity
of Grace? Are you of <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Altogether, <hi>Theodorus:</hi> I believe that a ſelf-denyal as
to ſenſible Pleaſure, after what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may imagine it to
be, cannot of it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite us to God, though the efficacy or the
prevailing of the Grace of Chriſt depends on that for the moſt part, I
believe that all Men have need of the Light <pb n="164" facs="tcp:42160:89"/>of Faith, and
that thoſe who are tempted by violent Pleaſures cannot overcome them by the
Grace of Light only: I believe they have ſtill need of prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
Pleaſure, eſpecially if they are us'd to follow the motions of their
Paſſions. As for the Righteous whoſe Hearts are ſtrongly fixt on God,
though they cannot overcome a Temptation without actual help, I believe that
Light alone, which they never want in preſſing occaſions, is commonly
ſufficient for that, and that the Joy which they feel in the practice of
Vertue, works in them the ſame effect that preingaging Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure does in
thoſe who are beginning that Converſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>But, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> why do you ſay that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
never want Light in great Temptations that tend to draw them away from God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis becauſe the Righteous are only ſuch ſo far as they love
God. Now thoſe that love him, even when they are in danger of loſing him,
have a deſire to keep to him; but they cannot deſire to keep to him without
thinking upon the means that may ſerve to that end, nor without
repreſenting to themſelves the greatneſs of their loſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſo, <hi>Eraſtus?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe the Natural Prayer that obtains of God the lively Idea
of an Object is the actual Will of thinking on this Object. For when we will
think on any thing, the Idea of this thing preſents its ſelf to our Mind,
and this Idea is ſo much the more lively the more firm our Will is.</p>
               <p>A Juſt Man loves God more than all other things, and in a
Temptation, by which he is in danger of loſing God, is in a condition of
ſeeing his loſs; nor can he ſee it without being ſenſible of it, nor
without deſiring to avoid it. His Will therefore Naturally 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42160:89"/>requires Light, and obtains ſo much the more of it, the
ſtronger his Deſire is, and the more fervent his Love; for 'tis this Love
that prays as it ought, and is always heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>This is true, <hi>Eraſtus:</hi> Our Good cannot be ſnatch'd
from us, but that at the ſame time we muſt be deſirous to preſerve it,
and this Deſire or Will is always followed by Light; for nothing gives ſo
much Light as Intereſt. Thoſe that look upon God as their true Good have
commonly Light enough in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Temptations, and uſually find out
means to avoid them. But, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> this only happens when the Love
is ſtrong, and the Temptation weak. There are ſome Righteous Men who love
God above all things, yet whoſe Love is not lively, being ſuffer'd by them
to languiſh for want of Nouriſhment, and weaken'd extreamly by that
Concupiſcence which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly wars againſt it; ſo that the Ideas,
which, according to the Laws of Nature, preſent themſelves to their Minds
in Temptation, diſſipate and vaniſh in a moment; they are of no
ſubſtance nor conſiſtence: But the Ideas which according to the Laws of
Nature are excited in the motions of the Paſſions are ſenſible. Thus,
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> leſt the Righteous ſhould fall, God muſt either give
them a greater Light than that which ſhould enſue from their love,
according to the Laws of Nature, or awaken and fortifie their love by a
preingaging delectation. But becauſe he does it if he pleaſes, and as much
as he pleaſes (this not being in courſe of Nature <hi>a thing</hi> to which
he is oblig'd) the Light of the Righteous and the Diſpoſition of their
Hearts, as ſufficient as it is, does not always give them the victory in the
time of Temptation.</p>

               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> but the Righteous can pray. God
has obliged himſelf by his Promiſes, which he keeps as inviolably as the
Laws of Nature, to give them continually actual and efficacious help, if they
have need of it. The Righteous are Members of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they are
animated with the Spirit of Chriſt; 'tis, as we may ſay, Chriſt that
prays in them, and God can refuſe nothing to his Son: For the Righteous
obtain nothing that they ask, unleſs they ask it in the Name of Chriſt, and
in order to preſerve the Spirit of Chriſt within them.</p>

               <p>But, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> when a Righteous Man through negligence
lets his love decay, when he lets the Light and Life of the Spirit dye in him,
God knows his wants, God loves him, for every Righteous Man is loved of God;
why then does he ſtay till he pray to him? Why does he not grant before he
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? Why does he not protect and defend him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>God does not always ſtay till the Righteous pray to him, but
often gives them help which they ask not of him; and if he does command them to
ask it of him, it is becauſe he will be lov'd and ador'd for it. God knows
our wants better than we do our ſelves; and if he commands us to pray to him,
'tis to oblige us to think on him, and to look upon him as the only Being that
is able to fill us with good things; 'tis to excite and awaken our love towards
him; and not to learn of us either our wants or the motives he has to relieve
us. He is reſolv'd to be gracious to us upon his Sons account, and if it is
his will that we pray to him for it in his Sons Name, 'tis that we may love him
and his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42160:90"/>'Tis love that prays, 'tis reſpect, 'tis
the diſpoſition of the Mind and Heart: For we cannot pray to God without
actually believing a great many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him and us, without actually
hoping in him, and actually loving him. But acts ſtir up and even beget
habits; therefore 'tis principally to awaken in us our Faith, our Hope and our
Love, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to pray to him.</p>
               <p>But when our Faith is lively, our Hope firm and our Love ardent,
it is not poſſible, according to the very Laws of Nature, we ſhould want
a lively and efficacious Light. For, as you ſay, 'tis impoſſible that
what we love ſhould be ſnatch'd away from us without exciting in us a
deſire to preſerve it; and this deſire is naturally follow'd with a
proſpect of the means to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Joy we find in the poſſeſſion of what we
ardently love is of great force: For the Righteous poſſeſs God by the
fore-taſte of their hope, and this fore-taſte accompanied with light is
able to make them overcome the ſtrongeſt Temptations, becauſe it makes
them embrace with Joy the means that the Light offers them. Thus Prayer is the
nouriſhment of the Soul, and by it it receives new ſtrength, by it it
thinks on God, and comes into his preſence, unites its ſelf to him, that is
its whole ſtrength; and even it receives of God, through Chriſt, the
delectation of Grace to counterballance thoſe preingaging Pleaſures which
it receives alſo of God (for 'tis God alone that acts in it) but which are
involuntary and rebellious by reaſon of <hi>Adam's</hi> diſobedience.</p>
               <p>And you ought to obſerve, <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that the
Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous have always in them the ſtrength to pray (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is Love
that prays) and conſequently ſtrength to <pb n="168" facs="tcp:42160:91"/>obtain an
increaſe of their Love, ſeeing that God has obliged himſelf by his
Promiſes to grant them their Prayers. Nay they can eaſily make uſe of
this ſtrength they have to pray at all times in which they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of
Spirit, and need of Prayer, eſpecially if they live in a retirement, and deny
themſelves ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures. For, as the Righteous love God, it is
eaſie for them, when they have liberty of Mind, and perceive that any thing
ſets them at a diſtance from God, to make ſome attempt to return to him
again: And this effort is an efficacious Prayer which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to
the greatneſs of the effort. They may fly to Chriſt, think on his
Counſels and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and if they cannot eaſily imitate his Life, they
may at leaſt deſire to do it, they may ſtrengthen their hope and raiſe
their love, by praying with Faith and Humility in the proſpect of the Merits
of Chriſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>They may do what you ſay, if they think upon it: But if they do
not think upon it, certainly they cannot do it; for none can do what you ſay
with out thinking on it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>They alwayes think upon it, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> when it is
neceſſary, becauſe, being righteous, they love God. For thoſe that love
God have him ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when there is danger of loſing him; becauſe
we cannot have that which we love ſnatch'd away from us, and not deſire to
preſerve it. I ſuppoſe, in the mean time, that they preſerve the
Liberty of their Minds by putting away Senſual Pleaſures; for ſometimes
the Imagination is ſo taken up and troubled by the Action of Bodies that are
about us, and by the Motion of the Spirits which the Paſſions raiſe in
us, that we may loſe God eaſily enough, and without making all the
Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <pb n="169" facs="tcp:42160:91"/>which I believe neceſſary to preſerve
and fortifie Love.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> we ſhould always return to the
Counſels of Chriſt. There is nothing more neceſſary for the Righteous,
as well as for Sinners, than to remove from the Noiſie World and Violent
Pleaſures; and I believe that thoſe who ſet no Bounds to their
Pleaſures, nor to their Paſſions, can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this Preſence
of God which bears up and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies their Love. I fancy that the Hurry,
Muſic, Pomp, Magnificence, and other Allurements that are at Publick Places,
would very much perplex my Mind, if I ſhould reſort thither; for, they
ſay, the Authors of thoſe Sports, which you formerly frequented ſo much,
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> have no other deſign than to raiſe the
Paſſions, and bewitch the Imagination. I think that if any Temptation
ſurprized me in thoſe Places, I ſhould not be Maſter of my ſelf
enough to reſiſt it; ſo I'm reſolv'd never to go thither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpeak with a great deal of Reaſon, <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> We
ſhould always ſeek the moſt <hi>ſimple,</hi> and moſt moderate
Diverſions; we ſhould uſe Recreations as harmleſs as are thoſe of
Children: But ſome People cannot be diverted without being diſturb'd;
theſe do not take their Diverſion as you do, merely to unbend their Mind;
alas! they never tire it with hard Study; they are for Diverſions that may
give ſome reſpite to their Paſſions, which weary them too much
becauſe they follow their violent Motions. Their deſign is not by this
means to ſettle again the Imagination in its natural Seat after it has been
harraſs'd by Meditation; but rather to put out of their Mind ſome
ambitious, or other unruly Thoughts which the Paſſions have exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and
which are no longer pleaſing to them; that ſo <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42160:92"/>they may
make themſelves more happy in following the Motions of Paſſions ſofter
and more moderate than thoſe that commonly move them: for after all, the
Paſſions which are Acted on the Stage do not ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move us, as
thoſe whoſe Object is real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> theſe Perſons are very
miſerable; their Imagination is much diſordered; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, or the
weight of Sin, (to uſe <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi>'s Expreſſion) weighs heavy
in their Scale, and there had need be a great deal of pre-ingaging Pleaſure
to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, they hope to be ſav'd like other Chriſtians,
and imagine, that, though they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for ordinary Graces
by following the Counſels of Chriſt, God will give them thoſe
extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Graces which overcome all the Malignity of the moſt corrupt
Minds. In ſhort, they ſay that it belongs to God to convert them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>When I hear your voluptuous or ambitious Men complain that God
does not give them ſuch Graces as may work their Converſion, methinks I
ſee a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of cruel Wretches that ſtab themſelves, and at the ſame
time accuſe God of the barbarity which they uſe againſt themſelves.
They expect that he ſhould do them good, while they are doing themſelves
harm; and at the very time that they cauſe in their Bodies ſuch Motions as
by the Order of Nature are ſtill to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Pain, they would have
God to alter that Order and Work Miracles for their ſakes.</p>
               <p>We cannot too often call to mind, that God always acts by the
moſt ſimple Means, and inviolably keeps the Laws which he has preſcribed
to himſelf, not only in the Order of Nature but alſo in that of Grace. The 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42160:92"/>ſimpleſt and ſhorteſt way for the Converſion of
Sinners, is, that they deprive themſelves of Pleaſures; this is plain: They
muſt therefore begin with this, and not flatter themſelves with the hopes
of ſuch extraordinary Graces as may really be eſteemed Miracles in the
Order of Grace.</p>
               <p>If we deſire to live, we muſt eat; if we would enjoy ſome
Pleaſure, we muſt excite within our Body thoſe Motions which Nature has
decreed ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with pleaſing Senſations; for, theſe
Motions oblige God, in Conſequence of his Will, to cauſe us to feel the
Pleaſure which we wiſhed for. So, if we would attain to a regenerate
ſtate, and live the Life of Grace, we ought to ween our ſelves of
ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, mortifie the Luſts of the Fleſh, and pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceaſing. Our Repentance and our Prayers will prevail with God, according to
his Promiſe, to beſtow on us ſuch Graces as are able to regenerate us.
But if we follow the Impulſe of our Paſſions, and rely on the Efficacy of
extraordinary Graces, 'tis as if ſome Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould caſt themſelves
headlong down a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, in hopes that God would do a Miracle to ſave
them.</p>
               <p>When we do not know what the Laws of Nature are, we learn them by
Experiments; but, when we know what thoſe Laws are, we look upon them to be
inviolable, and, conforming our Actions to them, we do not pretend to overturn
them. So, a Perſon who does not know that Fire may offend him, comes too near
it; but he no ſooner knows how it acts on him, but that he takes greater Care
of himſelf, neither does he think that the Fire ought to reſpect him if he
ſhould preſume to throw himſelf in the midſt of its Flames. Now if we
are ignorant in the Laws of Grace, we <pb n="172" facs="tcp:42160:93"/>ought to inform our
ſelves about them, and when we know what they are, we muſt be conformable
to them, and not think we may break them as we pleaſe; For, God's Will can
never be made to depend on our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichios.</p>
               <p>The Natural Philoſophers have but a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Inſight
into the particular Laws of Nature; for, Experiments, which are the ſureſt
Means to diſcover them, are very uncertain: yet, they revere and fear thoſe
Laws, as unknown as they are to them; and ſhall Chriſtians, void of all
Veneration and Fear for the Laws of Grace, which they do not know, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to reconcile all Things to their Deſigns? They know the Poyſon, but
becauſe it ſeems pleaſant, they ſwallow it without horrour.</p>
               <p>Reaſon teaches them, as we diſcover'd it at our laſt
Conference, that the ſhorteſt way for the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Nature is
Self-denial; the inward Sentiment of their Conſcience confirms the Decree of
their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the Admonitions of our Saviour, his Example, thoſe of all
good Men, do not ſuffer them to doubt of it; yet they take pleaſure in
blinding themſelves not to diſcover the neceſſity they lye under to
follow that Means; and if they find themſelves oblig'd to own how
neceſſary it is to follow this Direction given us by Chriſt, all the
deference they pay to it is often barely exteriour; denying themſelves ſome
certain Things which they do not value; and ſuffering a carnal
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that is not the Circumciſion of the Heart which God requires
of them.</p>
               <p>When we conſider the Life of our Saviour's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, who was,
in a manner, the Perſonal Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Subſtantial Grace; for, St.
<hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was ſent to repreſent to us by his Preaching
and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42160:93"/>of Life all the things that prepare us for
the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Grace, as Chriſt was ſent to impart it to us: When we
conſider, I ſay, that living Pattern of Preparation to Grace, we ſee in
him nothing but a ſeparation from the World, a continual ſelf-denyal even
as to the things that ſeem needful for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Life; for you know
what is ſaid of him in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4. Thus his Example
ſufficiently teaches us what we are to do to befit our ſelves for the
receiving of Grace. But our imagination, wholly deprav'd by ſenſible
Pleaſures, ſoon takes off our Eyes from this model of Mortification and
Penitence, to mould us another of ſome Perſon whom the World eſteems a
good Man, though he indulges himſelf in the Pleaſures which St.
<hi>John</hi> diſclaim'd as contrary to the ways through which Chriſt comes
to dwell in us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ariſt.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt needs own to you, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that all the Heroes
whom I have hitherto ſet before my ſelf as living Exemplars to walk by, are
more generous and communicative than St. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> ſince
they are not afraid of being ſociable, nor of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the World;
injoying certain Pleaſures which they term Civil and Gentleman-like
Recreations. I don't know whether they allow themſelves this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as
knowing themſelves ſtrong enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; but I think my ſelf
obliged in Conſcience to let <hi>Eraſtus</hi> know that I never fail'd to
become a ſlave to a great many Pleaſures, when, like theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic
Gentlemen I was not afraid to enjoy them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>I would not make the Opinion of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the Rule of my
Conduct; I know we ought to follow a Rule, and be guided by Reaſon; ſince,
to act only by a Principle of Imitation has more of the Brute in it than of the
Man. I thank <hi>Theodorus</hi> for putting <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42160:94"/>me in mind of
this. If we ſet our ſelves a Pattern to imitate, 'tis that its Example may
excite us reſolutely to do what we know Reaſon directs us to perform: For,
<hi>as all Men are apt to err and to ſin, no Man can be to us an infallible
Rule;</hi> Reaſon ought to correct the defects of the Exemplar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>Reaſon ought alſo to make choice of theſe Exemplars. For,
many times our Imagination, daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled by the deceitful luſtre of falſe
Vertues, makes us admire a Heroe inſtead of a Saint; and becauſe 'tis much
more pleaſant and eaſie to live like the firſt than like the latter, that
we may juſtifie our conduct, we are very ready to ſet before our ſelves
ſuch Exemplars as ſuit with our humours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eraſt.</speaker>
               <p>The ſureſt way is to imitate ſuch Exemplars as God
preſcribes us to follow; ſince God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. Our Saviour's
Precepts are undoubtedly the beſt, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s Conduct is
altogether conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them; we muſt then walk after him. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
Reaſon obliges me to retire like him to Deſarts, that I may avoid the
Contagion which rages in the World, and prepare for the Grace of Chriſt. For,
after all, Reaſon has convinc'd me that St. <hi>John</hi> is a good Pattern
to imitate; the Holy Ghoſt ſets him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Scripture, and our
Saviour highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends him for his holineſs of Life. What do you think,
<hi>Theodorus,</hi> do you believe I ought to imitate him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theod.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know, <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> but if you ought not to follow
him, I know you ought to follow Chriſt. As St. <hi>John</hi> prepar'd us for
Grace, but did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it, he was to ſhow us an Example of the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt auſterity: 'Twas his Duty to take out of the Scale all the
Weights in general that make it have a <pb n="175" facs="tcp:42160:94"/>propenſity to
cleave to the Earth, becauſe he could not give us the weight of Grace to make
the Scales even. As the precurſor of the Author of Grace, he was to remove by
his Preaching and Example all the impediments that kept us from receiving
Chriſt. For this Reaſon it was fit he ſhould with the greateſt
ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imaginable forbid us the uſe of Worldly injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this was
his Duty.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt teaches us to make uſe of theſe things. The
weight of his Grace ſets us free, becauſe it ſets the Scales even again.
With that Grace we may live in the World without becoming ſlaves to it,
becauſe it hinders us from loving the World. We may injoy the things of this
World, becauſe by the means of his Grace we enjoy them without Pleaſure,
<hi>as enjoying them not;</hi> or rather, becauſe the Pleaſure which
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Grace is ſtronger than that which we find in the uſe of theſe
things. But we muſt take great care that the liberty which is given us by the
Grace of Chriſt do not give us occaſion to live according to the Fleſh.
We may be ſav'd without hating the World; and if while we live in the World
we love it and become ſlaves to its Pomp, Reaſon teaches us that we ought
to forſake it; for, we cannot overcome it without Chriſt; and if his Grace
dwelt in us, we ſhould feel within our ſelves a Power able to overcome the
World. We may uſe certain Pleaſures on ſome occaſions, but never
without fear and horrour; and if we uſe them without fear and horrour, we
ought to avoid them.</p>
               <p>Charity obliges us to live with the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for, Grace
does not deſtroy Civil Society: But the ſame Charity obliges us to ſettle
ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them as may not end with this Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:42160:95"/>I own that Chriſt <hi>did not come to
ſend Peace on Earth: he came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword. He came to
ſet a Man at variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt her
Mother, and the Daughter in law againſt the Mother in law,</hi> Matth.
10.34,35. <hi>If there be five in one houſe he is come to divide them, and to
ſet three againſt two, and two againſt three,</hi> Luke 12.52. He came to
ſet Man at variance even with himſelf. <hi>If any man hate not his own
life, and does not bear his Croſs and come after Chriſt, he cannot be his
Diſciple,</hi> nor worthy to be call'd a Chriſtian. But our Saviour came to
do theſe things only that he might reunite us to God, reconcile us to our
ſelves, and, even in this Life, begin a fellowſhip that is to laſt
eternally.</p>
               <p>Do you think, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you, whoſe Heart is ſo
ſuſceptible of Friendſhip, that 'tis poſſible you ſhould here below
have a real love for a perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you love him as a Chriſtian? You may
indeed love him well enough; ſo far as Civil Society, which depends on the
relation which Bodies have to one another, requires it; but you are neither in
a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know him ſuch as he is, nor even to know your ſelf. Do you
fancy you ſee your Friend, when you behold a certain diſpoſition of
matter, which is call'd a Face, or when you hear the ſound of words that move
the Air? I don't believe you do. But if you do not ſee your Friend, what is
it you love then, when you think you love him? Certainly you either muſt love
your ſelf, and then your Love is ſelfiſh; or you love your Friend's Face,
and then your Love is unworthy your Friend; or elſe you love your Friend's
Vertue and upright Principles, and in that caſe your Friendſhip is juſt;
but then 'tis a Chriſtian <pb n="177" facs="tcp:42160:95"/>Friendſhip; for thus you
love God in your Friend, or your Friend as he has a relation to God; you love
him becauſe he belongs to God, lives according to God's Commands, and makes
his own Will conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of God.</p>
               <p>And yet, Sir, your Friendſhip is ſtill imperfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you don't know what you love. As you don't ſee your Friend's Mind in a clear
and diſtinct manner, you cannot really love him; for, if you ſaw him
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, you would perhaps abhor him.</p>

               <p>We begin even in this Life to love God and our Neighbour; but
becauſe we are not to have a clear ſight of God nor of our Neighbour till

               <p>I juſt now diſcover'd it. His Mother and I wondring that he
was not at home at Dinner-time, I went up into his Chamber to look for him, and
found this Letter ſeal'd up on his Table.</p>

                  <head>For <hi>Ariſtarchus.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Am convinc'd, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> by Reaſon and by Faith;
by a clear Light, and an infallible Authority; by the intelligible words of
inward Truth, and by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible words of incarnate Truth; in ſhort, by
all that can convince a Rational and Chriſtian Soul; that the moſt ſafe
and uſual way to come to God, is to ſeclude our ſelves from the World,
and deprive our ſelves of all ſenſual things. But I ought to take the
greater care; for, the more the buſineſs is of conſequence, the more 'tis
neceſſary, difficult and dangerous. I ought therefore,
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> to retire to ſome place where I may be ſhelter'd
againſt the perſecution of thoſe who would have me apply my ſelf to
ſome ſtudies that are <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42160:96"/>neceſſary to qualifie a
Gentleman for ſome Employments, to which I do not find my ſelf to have a
particular Call.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed I do not find my ſelf to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and
extraordinary call for the deſign I have; But there needs no particular Call
when Reaſon alone, and the general vocation of Chriſtians is ſufficient.
Without doubt thoſe who engage in the affairs of this World ought to have a
particular Call to that way of living; for Reaſon and our general vocation
teach us to do otherwiſe: But, as the World goes now, methinks a Man needs
but to have common Senſe and to believe the Goſpel, to do what I have
done.</p>
                  <p>However, as I would not engage in a particular Courſe of Life
without a particular Call, I'll be ſtill ready to return to you, when 'tis
neceſſary. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, I would think my ſelf guilty of a leſs
fault, ſhould I, without a particular Call, preſume to conform my ſelf to
the way of living of the Religious Perſons with whom I intend to live; than
if, without a Call, I enter'd into the Bonds of Matrimony, or took an
Employment that would tye me to too many things.</p>
                  <p>All my Relations perſecute me, every one according to his humour
and ambition. They have ends which I neither have nor would have. Beſides I
would gladly break off the Society which I have with ſome infectious Wits,
who perhaps will abhor me at my coming back. In ſhort, I believe I ought
ſeriouſly to mind what is moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential. <hi>Anthimus</hi> and
<hi>Philemon</hi> are very fit to finiſh what <hi>Theodorus</hi> hath begun.
So, I am now going to them; you know they have wiſh'd for my coming a long
while.</p>
                  <p>I beg that you will not impute my withdrawing my ſelf without
any previous leave or notice, to a want of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <pb n="180" facs="tcp:42160:97"/>for you, or of Dutifulneſs to my Mother. Far from this; I did it
becauſe the Natural Affection which I ought to have for her, and you, is too
violent. I dreaded the Conſequences of it in the performance of a Deſign
which I was reſolved to fulfil, for fear of being wanting in that which I owe
to God; but at laſt I perſwaded my ſelf, that as my Mother and you have a
very great eſteem for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom I am now going, you will, both
of you, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the omiſſion of a peice of Formality, which I could not
keep, merely out of too deep a ſenſe of Love for you.</p>
                  <p>I did not dare write to my Mother at firſt; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, deareſt Cozen, perſwade her to admit of the Aſſurances of my Duty
and Submiſſion: I know that, next to God, I owe all things to her. As for
<hi>Theodorus,</hi> I pray you to tell him, that I'll continually meditate on
the Principles which he diſcover'd to me; and that I love Truth extremely. By
this he'll eaſily know that I'll ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be without thinking of him.</p>

               <p>If you would know, Sir, what I think of <hi>Eraſtus;</hi> I
muſt needs tell you, that I never knew a more juſt and penetrating Mind, a
purer and clearer Imagination, a ſweeter and more honourable Temper, a more
upright and generous Heart; and in ſhort, that I never ſaw a more
accompliſht young Man than <hi>Eraſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his Conduct, if you blame any thing in it, do but Anſwer
what his Letter ſays in his Juſtification: Finding himſelf here holden by
Tyes that inſlave him, he breaks them publickly, not being able to get free
otherwiſe. He is afraid of not being able to preſerve the Purity of his
Imagination, the Freedom of his Mind, and the Love of True Good, among
Perſons who uſe to take all Things upon Truſt without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42160:97"/>the Truth, and who, by their impoſing Ways and
infectious Behaviour, are continually like to make ſome

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Impreſſions on his Mind.
You ſee that even ſome of his Relations perſecute and ſeduce him. They
endeavour to bring him in to the World for their own Credit; and they would
have him to become conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable there, that his Advancement may promote
theirs, and his Glory reflect ſome upon them. But <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is
convinc'd by the Strength of Reaſon, that Wealth, Pomp, and Greatneſs,
diſorder the Minds of thoſe that enjoy them; he is alſo convinced of it
by the Authority of Chriſt: Would you not have him be guided by his Light,
and Faith? Would you have him graſp a Phantaſm that vaniſhes, court a
Stage-Greatneſs, and feed himſelf up with Illuſions and Chimaera's?
Either let them prove to him that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a falſe Light, and that
Chriſt is a Seducer, or elſe let him alone.</p>

               <p>Do not think, <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that I have the leaſt Thing to
object againſt his Conduct; I will rather follow him than diſturb him in
his Deſign: He is in the Right; I am fully convinced of it, not only by what
we ſaid in our former Conferences; but alſo by what he ſaid to me
Yeſterday, when I was come back from my Friend's. Would you have me give you
ſome account of it?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſtus</hi> never expreſt himſelf with more Eloquence
and Happineſs of Thought: He told me, among other Things, that, Man is not
only united to his own Body, but alſo to all thoſe that ſurround him;
that our Paſſions diffuſe our Soul into all ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42160:98"/>as our Senſes diffuſe it through every part of the
Body; and that thoſe who launch into the wide World, continually running
after Riches, Pleaſures, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, diſſipate and loſe themſelves
by being diſperſt as it were out of themſelves.</p>
               <p>While they fancy that they enlarge their own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they weaken
themſelves; and become Slaves to thoſe whom they would command: And while
they encreaſe their Power on the Bodies that ſurround them, they loſe
that which they have on the Truth that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates them.</p>
               <p>Let me conſider, ſaid he, how Man comes to be ſenſible.
Out of his Brain certain Nerves are emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whoſe infinite number of
Branches are diſperſt over all the Parts of his Body. Theſe Nerves, or
Fibres, which correſpond to the Seat of the Soul, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate her as ſoon as
they are ſtirred; they diſperſe her through all the Parts into which they
inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and whatſoever happens in the Body breaks her
Quiet and diſturbs her.</p>
               <p>Now let me examine the Condition which that Man is in who is led
by his Paſſions, and faſten'd to every Thing. Out of his Heart ſome
Bonds may in one ſenſe be ſaid to be emitted, and thence their ſtrings
are diſperſt through all ſenſible Objects. Theſe Strings are no
ſooner ſtirr'd by the Motion of thoſe Objects, but his Heart is alſo
mov'd. If theſe Objects are remov'd at ſome diſtance, his Heart muſt
follow, or be torn. In ſhort, his Soul diſperſes her ſelf by the Means
of theſe Tyes through whatever ſurrounds him, juſt as ſhe diffuſes
her ſelf by the Means of Nerves over every Part of the Body.</p>
               <p>When a Man inconſiderately gives himſelf up to the Commerce of
the World, the Tyes of his Heart faſten <pb n="183" facs="tcp:42160:98"/>him to a
Thouſand Objects which only ſerve to make him wretched; and if he be mad
enough to have a real Love for thoſe Objects, or to be puſſt up with his
new Greatneſs, he is (ſaid he to me) like thoſe who would be proud of a
Dropſie, or of Wens or Bunches that ſwell their Body to a bigger Bulk than
ordinary.</p>
               <p>Do you think (continued he) that the Souls of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic Men are
greater than thoſe of other Men? They have, indeed, a larger Body, and can
put a greater Maſs of Matter into Motion; but if you examine them well,
you'll find that their Motions are more irregular. The very Horſes and
Elephants are ſtronger than they and more bulky, and if theſe Men
meaſur'd the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Soul by that of their Body they would make
themſelves univerſally ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Yet it were a juſter Thing to meaſure the Greatneſs of the
Soul by that of the Body, than by that of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Honours, For, after all,
our Body is more our own than our Wealth, and we are more united to it, than we
are to our Clothes, our Houſe, or our Lands: How fooliſh and vain then are
not Men when they pretend to grow greater by being diſperſt out of
themſelves!</p>
               <p>Truely (cry'd he) Imaginary Greatneſs makes Men become very
miſerable Creatures. Every thing offends them; every thing diſturbs them;
every thing holds them faſt. And can Men in a perpetual Hurry, and, as it
were, wounded in every Part, be able to Think? Can they be able to cleave to
Truth for which alone they are made, with which alone they can be nouriſh'd,
and through which alone they can grow more wiſe and more happy? They are
commonly mad, ſtupid, thoughtleſs Creatures, void of Light and
Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42160:99"/>Do you think (added he) that the Voluptuous,
and thoſe who continually ſtrive to extend their Slavery by enlarging the
Bounds of their Commands, do ſo much as know that they are not made for
Bodies, nor for a Time, and that they are not on Earth barely to live there?
Alas! they know nothing of this; they do not perceive that Bodies are inferiour
to them, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of acting on them, and altogether unworthy of their Love.
As they have not yet felt the Sting of Death, they cannot ſtrictly be ſaid
to know they ſhall dye. Their Tongues indeed ſay, they muſt; and they
believe it; but they do not know it: They think they ſhall be no more, but
they do not know they ſhall dye.</p>
               <p>What vaſt difference is there not between ſeeing and ſeeing!
'Tis but a very little while ſince I know, that I am not made for Corporeal
Beings, that the Figure of this World paſſeth away, that the true Good of
Spirits is a Spiritual Good, and even ſince I know what it is to dye. Nay, as
my Underſtanding is but ſmall, I have too been obliged to think with my
utmoſt application to comprehend theſe Truths. Before this, I thought of
Death what my Eyes diſcover'd to me of it, and ſcarce any thing more: And
if I had not been in a greater Capacity of applying my ſelf to thinking than
thoſe who are in the Hurry of Buſineſs or a hunting after Pleaſure, I
muſt confeſs, I had not known what I believe is unknown to great Numbers of
Men.</p>
               <p>The application of the Mind produces Light and diſcovers Truth:
The ſight of Truth gives perfection to the Mind, and regulates the Heart:
Such an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is then neceſſary. But can a Man when he is pull'd and
drawn on all ſides, ſtruck and wounded every where, thruſt back when he
would get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42160:99"/>dragg'd forwards when he would go
back, and continually diſturb'd and miſus'd; can ſuch a Man, I ſay,
think with application? Can a Man who fears every thing, yet deſires, hopes
for, and runs after every thing, think on what he does not ſee?</p>
               <p>Truth is diſtant, and not ſenſible, nor is it a Good which
we find our ſelves preſs'd to love: We muſt ſeek it, if we would find
it; But we may ſtill put off the Search; for, it never wholly leaves us. On
the contrary, Bodies cauſe themſelves to be felt every Moment, preſs us
to love them, and continually oblige us to cleave to them, for they are
tranſitory, and leave us as ſoon as they have tempted us. So, becauſe
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity when loſt is not eaſily recover'd, Men are quickly determin'd
to enjoy them; but as for Truth, they put off from time to time the applying of
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, becauſe it never leaves them, nor cauſes it ſelf to
be felt, and for that reaſon it does not preſs them to love it.</p>
               <p>How happy are thoſe (added he) who wait for Eternity in
Deſerts, and who, finding themſelves too weak to preſerve the Freedom of
their Mind and the purity of their Imagination againſt the Efforts and
Malignity of ſenſible Objects, have bravely broken off all their Bonds to
be ſtrictly joyn'd to God! But how much to be pitied are not thoſe whom God
calls to live in the Midſt of the World, to convert it; what Woes have they
not to undergo! what Enemies to fight with! I tremble (ſaid he) when I think
on't; yet with Chriſt's Help any Thing may be brought under.</p>
               <p>Yet (continued he) do you think we are oblig'd to live amidſt
the Hurry of the World? For my part, I do not ſee that God calls me to this.
And indeed the Glories of the World dazzle me; my Imagnation 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42160:100"/>grows confus'd, my Mind diſſipates it ſelf, and I
am diſperſt and out of my ſelf as ſoon as I do not keep a ſtrict
Watch over my Actions.</p>
               <p>As for you (ſaid he to me) you are ſtrong; you are not afraid
of the World; your Imagination is firm and ſettled, and God has given you
Grace to loath the World, after you had enjoyed its Pleaſures. I admire
(added he skilfully, to make me reflect on my inward Miſery) how the Traces,
which were imprinted on your Brain by ſenſible Objects, could ſo happily
wear out; how the Paſſions, whoſe Impulſe you formerly follow'd, could
be calm'd; and how the Commerce which you have had with the World, does not
encreaſe and prompt Concupiſcence in you! As you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, that
the Figure of this World paſſeth away, you enjoy it as enjoying it not;
for, a Man of your Senſe will not ſuffer himſelf to be deceived twice.
But I alas! am ſo ſtupid, that I have no ſooner got out of a Snare but I
fall into it again; and I am ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible as to fancy my ſelf wholly
free, while I am a Slave to my Paſſions. As ſoon as I have reſolv'd to
get rid of ſome ill Habit, I fondly imagine I have really caſt it off; So
that I am like a Patient who thinks he is perfectly cur'd, merely becauſe he
paſſionately deſires to get out of Bed and go abroad.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſpoke thus, I felt within me what he
ſaid of himſelf; and knew him to have that Firmneſs of Mind for which he
commended me. This ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruck me, and laid me open to my ſelf in
ſo clear and lively a manner, that the State of my Soul at once affected me
with Terrour and Pity; while on the other ſide <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſeem'd to
me ſo lovely and ingenious; and ſpoke to me in ſo ſweet and natural a
manner, that I could not but give the deepeſt Attention imaginable to 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42160:100"/>what he ſaid. But at laſt, after he had ſpoken
ſome of thoſe Words which never come out of the Mouth but when the Heart is
open, he lookt in my Face to read in my Eyes the Effect which they had produc'd
in my Soul; and ſeeing me as I was then, his Countenance at once chang'd
according to mine; his Speech fail'd him as mine did me; he open'd his Mouth,
but was not able to utter a Word; and when we had gaz'd on each other a Moment
more to know one another, our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order encreas'd, and we were oblig'd to
part.</p>
               <p>This is part of what paſt between <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and my
ſelf at our laſt Enterview; for I have not ſeen him to day; and, by the
little I have now told you of it, you may believe that he has not only
convinc'd my Reaſon, but alſo made himſelf Maſter of my Heart.
When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I think on him, I, as it were, feel him drawing me along; but while
he takes me with him, the things I leave call me back, and I loſe him.
However, I do not loſe him for a long time, and I know very well what I
ſhall do.</p>

<hi>Eraſtus</hi> is in the Path in which I would tread, becauſe I know 'tis
the beſt. I own that I have a particular Love for him, and the Example he
ſhows me makes me reſolve to do what I think I ought to do: But I follow
the Dictates of my Reaſon, I obey the Goſpel, and walk in the Way that
leads me whither I would go; though Children or Mad-men went before me, I ought
not to go out of it; <pb n="188" facs="tcp:42160:101"/>for when a Man hath Buſineſs, he

               <p>I have laviſh'd the beſt half of my Life in the Hurry of

that I hardly know any thing of the Chriſtian Religion and Morals, but what I

the Holy Scripture with him; All keep my Word to him; his Retirement ought not
to make me forbear it; for, that ſort of Study is moſt proper in a
Retirement. In ſhort, had not I a mind to endeavour, as much as I can, wholly
to convert my Friend, I ſhould not a little ſurprize <hi>Eraſtus;</hi>
for I then would be before him where he is a going. But I hope to ſurprize
him otherwiſe; perhaps I ſhall not go by my ſelf to meet him there: My
Friend's Heart is chang'd; and as 'tis difficult he ſhould be able to lead a
Chriſtian Life in the ſight of the Libertines, with whom he formerly kept
Company, who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually perſecute him, I believe 'twill be no hard

               <p>You are in the Right, <hi>Ariſtarchus;</hi> I adviſe you to
relate to your Friend what paſs'd between you and <hi>Erastus,</hi> juſt as
you told it me now, and to give him an account of the Deſign you have to
follow him. If he ſincerely deſires to alter his Courſe of Life, I am
ſure he wiſhes for ſome Place to which he may retire: 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42160:101"/>For 'tis likely, he does not find himſelf arm'd with a
Reſolution ſtrong enough to conquer the Shame which thoſe who follow
Chriſt are put to by the World. But your Overture, backt with your Example,
will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably make him reſolve to fly to ſome dark Retreat.</p>
               <p>The Thing, in doing of which a Man who is in great Reputation in
the World finds moſt difficulty, is in reſolving to paſs for a Fool or
Mad-man the reſt of his Life. But let that Man think that he forſakes the
World and follows ſuch a Friend as you, and then his Imagination will not
ſo much diſturb his Reaſon. For our Imagination is uſually comforted by
Examples; and if on one ſide it fancies that ſome Men will laugh at what we
are going to do, it remembers at the ſame time that thoſe Scoffers will be
diſtant and are now nothing to us.</p>
               <p>Your Friend who ſo often laugh'd at thoſe whom he now would
imitate, beſt knows how hard a Thing it is to live among Worldly Men, and not
do as they do. He has experienc'd that thoſe who would lead a godly,
righteous, and ſober Life, muſt ſuffer Perſecution. He has not forgot
how he has uſed others, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cannot reſolve to condemn himſelf,
in leading a new ſort of Life among his old Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Thus you'll doubtleſs eaſe him very much, if you entreat him
to follow your Example; and this will certainly prevail with him, if, as you
ſay, he intends to change his Life.</p>

ſelves to be laught at. When the Imagination has been contaminated, the
leaſt matter diſorders it: So thoſe who have formerly given themſelves
up to their Pleaſures, ought to deny themſelves many Things which other Men
may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to injoy. And when our Reputation runs too great a danger, we
naturally model our ſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit and Ways of the World: So
that we ought to be, as it were, hidden, if we would live according to the
Light of Reaſon and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>When we are alone, we take what Countenance or Poſture we
pleaſe; but when we are in Company, we loſe that ſort of Freedom;
becauſe the Preſence of others naturally ſpreads on our Face an Air
ſuitable to the Quality and to the Diſpoſition of Mind of the Perſons
that ſpeak to us.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of our Conduct; we live as we pleaſe
when we are alone; but we are, as it were, oblig'd to do as others do, and
follow their Maxims when we run too great a Riſque of being laugh'd at, and
fear the Cenſures of too many People.</p>
               <p>We were made to live in Society one with another; And the Natural
Union which we have with Men, is now ſtronger and ſtricter than that which
we have with God. So that we often ſwerve from Truth, and from Juſtice, out
of meer Complaiſance. We offend God rather than diſoblige our Worldly
Acquaintance; and prefer their Applauſe, to the Teſtimony of our
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; fearing leſs the ſecret Checks of our Reaſon, and the
terrible Threats of the Living God, than the ſilly Laughter of Worldly
Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42160:102"/>Thus, <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> you juſtly
believe that the Ways of the World might lead both you and your Friend
aſtray. Therefore ſtedfaſtly follow your Light; and retire to ſome
Solitude to breath an uncorrupted Air; ſhun an Enemy whom you fear to engage;
break the Bonds that detain you in Captivity; but break them publickly and with
Noiſe; that having made your ſelf ridiculous in the Eyes of carnal Men, you
may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to appear before them, and that your Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may no more
urge you to look back, but rather that it may excite you to be private, that
you may enjoy the Freedom you deſire.</p>
               <p>A private Receſs chiefly befits thoſe who are oblig'd to
mortifie their Affections and lead a moſt penitent Life, thoſe who are like
your Friend, whom you have deſcrib'd to me as a Perſon who us'd blindly to
follow all the Dictates of his Paſſions: For, 'tis neceſſary that
thoſe who have wallow'd in Pleaſure ſhould live after the ſtricteſt
and moſt Self-denying way; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Humiliation practis'd in
Religious Houſes is the ſureſt Means to pull down the Pride of the
Mind.</p>
               <p>Endeavour, then, to ſave your Friend, and, with him, alſo your
ſelf. Be ſure to make uſe of all theſe Arguments, to prevail with him
to forſake the World; and, in ſhort, help and ſupport one another. The
Advice which I now give you, does not indeed ſquare very well with the common
Sentiments of Friendſhip; but I dare ſay, you will give me leave to wiſh
you that which I know is your True Good; ſince, though I ſeem to loſe you
for a Time, it is only that I may find my ſelf again united to you, by Tyes
as powerful as God himſelf, and as laſting as Eternity.</p>

               <head>TO THE READER.</head>
               <p>THE Deſign of the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations is to humble the
proud Soul, and to incline it to Repentance.</p>
               <p>Man is ſo mean a thing, that the very Knowledge of him is
Naturally attended with Contempt; and he is ſo corrupt and degenerate, that
'tis impoſſible to avoid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, when we conſider him as he is in
himſelf, and without relation to the Great Reſtorer of all things. I
ſhall endeavour to repreſent him as a Creature, as the Son of a Sinful
Father, and a Sinner himſelf; and I am perſwaded that this will be
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <pb facs="tcp:42160:105"/>to inſpire us with juſt and becoming
ſentiments of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>If thoſe who have had a lively and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe both
of their Miſeries and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did ever afterwards remain dead to
Pleaſures, uncapable of Vanity, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinc'd of Eſſential
Truths; theſe Meditations would be proper only for ſuch as are juſt
beginning to ſet about the Work of their Converſion. But I think I may
adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſure the Reader that they will be profitable to all that
ſhall be willing to make uſe of them; not ſo much by enlarging their
Knowledge as by fixing their Thoughts on ſuch things as they would not
otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with due application.</p>

                  <p>MAN, in himſelf, is but a meer Nothing: His very Being
depends abſolutely on the Will of God; and if God ſhould only ceaſe to
will his Exiſtence, he would at the ſame time ceaſe to be. For, the Power
that God has to annihilate his Creatures, does not conſiſt in willing their
Non-exiſtence, ſince <hi>Nothing</hi> includes no Good, and cannot be the
Object of a Poſitive Act of Gods Will. But he is able to deſtroy them
meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by 
<note n="*" place="margin">Not that God can ceaſe to will what
he once did will, ſince his Will is Eternal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable: But he might
have will'd from all Eternity, and by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable Will, that I ſhould
exiſt to this very moment, and no longer.</note> ceaſing to will that they
ſhould continue to be; for ſince the Creatures do not contain all
Goodneſs, they are not neceſſarily and indiſpenſably lovely; and God
himſelf includes all that Perfection and Goodneſs that is in them.</p>

                     <p>O GOD, make me continually ſenſible of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on
thy Almighty Will, my Being is thine, and the duration of my Being, or my Time,
is alſo thine. How great then is my Injuſtice! My Being is in a manner the
Being of God; and my Time is properly God's Time; for I am more God's than my
own, or rather, I am not at all my own, nor do I ſubſiſt by my ſelf;
and yet I neither live nor employ God's Time but for my ſelf. Alas! how do I
deceive my ſelf! O my God, all that Time which I do not employ for thee, I
cannot be ſaid to employ it for my ſelf; and I can neither ſeek nor find
my ſelf, but by ſeeking and finding thee.</p>

                  <head>The Second Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>MAN, in himſelf is nothing but Weakneſs and Infirmity. He
cannot deſire Good in general, but by vertue of a continual Impreſſion
from God, who does inceſſantly turn and force him towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for
God is that <hi>indefinite</hi> and univerſal Good, which comprehends all
other good things. Man is alſo not able by himſelf to deſire any
Particular Good; but only ſo far as he is capable of determining the
Impreſſion which he receives from God.</p>
                  <p>Man is utterly unable to do Good, but through a new ſupply
of Grace, which illuminates him by its Light, and attracts him by its
Sweetneſs; for, by himſelf, he is only able to Sin.</p>
                  <p>He could not ſo much as move his Hand, if God did not
communicate to his Blood and to the Aliment <pb n="375" facs="tcp:42160:106"/>by which he
is nouriſhed, a part of that Motion which he has ſpread through the whole
Maſs of Matter, and afterwards determine the Motion of the Spirits accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the different Acts of the impotent Will of Man, by guiding them towards the
Pipes of the Nerves, which the Man himſelf does not ſo much as know.</p>
                  <p>A Man indeed may deſire to move his Hand, but 'tis God alone
that can, and knows how to move it. For if Man did not eat, and if that which
he eats were not digeſted, and agitated in his Entrails and Heart, to be
afterwards turn'd to Blood and Spirits, without expecting the Orders of his
Will, or if theſe Spirits were not guided by a knowing Hand, through a
Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of different Tubes, it would be in vain for Man, who is ignorant of
his own Body, to deſire to put it into Motion.</p>

                     <p>O GOD, let me never forget that without thee I can neither
deſire nor do any thing, not even ſo much as move the ſmalleſt Member
of my Body. Thou, O God, art all my Strength, in thee do I place all my Hope
and Confidence. Do thou cover me with ſhame and confuſion, and fill me with
inward remorſe, if ever I ſhall be guilty of ſo much Ingratitude and
Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to lift up that Arm againſt thee, which owes even that

                  <head>The Third Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>MAN, in himſelf, is nothing but Darkneſs. He does not
produce in himſelf thoſe Ideas by which he perceives all things, for he is
not his own Light; and ſince Philoſophy teaches me that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cannot
form in the Mind thoſe Ideas by which they are repreſented, it muſt be
acknowledg'd that 'tis God alone who enlightens us. He is that great Sun which
penetrates all things, and fills them with his Light, and that Great Maſter
who inſtructs every Man that comes into the World. All that we ſee we ſee
in him, and in him we may ſee all that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſeeing. For
ſince God includes the Ideas or likeneſſes of all Beings, and we alſo
are in him, for <hi>in him we live, move, and have our Being,</hi> 'tis certain
that we ſee or may ſucceſſively ſee all Beings in him. He is that
intelligible World in which all Spirits are, and in which they perceive the
Material World, which is neither viſible, nor intelligible by it ſelf.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>MAN, by himſelf, is inſenſible, and in a manner Dead.
The Body cannot act upon its own Soul. A Sword indeed may pierce me, and
cauſe ſome alteration in the Fibres of my Fleſh, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive clearly
that it cannot make me ſuffer Pain. A harmonious ſound may firſt ſhake
the Air, and then the Fibres of my Brain; but my Soul cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by
it. My Soul is far above my Body, neither is there any neceſſary Relation
between thoſe two Parts of my ſelf. On the other hand I find that
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Pain, and all my other Senſations, are produced in me without
any dependency upon me, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even in ſpight of all my endeavours
to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And therefore I cannot doubt but that there is a Being
different from my Soul, which inſpires it with Life and Senſation, and I
know no other Power but that of God which is able to act thus upon his
Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 'Tis he then who is the Soveraign of the Soul, and can only
puniſh or reward it.</p>

                     <p>O GOD, ſince I live but by thee, make me alſo to live
only for thee, and may I be inſenſible of all things but the love of thee.
O God, make me ſenſible that none of all the Creatures can either hurt me,
or do me good: That there is not one among them all that can make me feel
either Pleaſure or Pain: That I ought neither to ſcar nor love them: That
thou alone, O my God, deſerveſt both my love and fear; becauſe thou art 
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42160:108"/>only able to reward me with the Joys of thy Elect, or
puniſh me with the Torments of the Reprobate.</p>
                     <p>O my chaſte Delight, thou Author of Nature, and cauſe of
all the Pleaſures that I feel, thou knoweſt that theſe very Pleaſures
inſtead of uniting me to thee, who alone canſt make me ſenſible of
them, chain me like a wretched Slave to the Earth; Grant, I beſeech thee,
that I may never more be ſo violently aſſaulted by them in the uſe of
thoſe things which thou haſt forbidden. Scatter a holy dread, and a
wholeſome bitterneſs on the Objects of my Senſes, that I may be able to
diſengage my ſelf from them; and let me feel in thy love thoſe
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable delights of thy Grace which may unite me cloſer to thee. Grant
that the ſweetneſs which I taſte in loving thee may augment my love; and
that my love may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the ſenſe that I have of thy ſweetneſs. May I
grow thus in Charity, till at laſt being full of thee, and empty of my ſelf
and every thing elſe, I may re-enter, and loſe my ſelf in thee, O my All,
as in the Fountain of all Beings. May that Word, <hi>God ſhall be All in
All,</hi> be entirely accompliſhed on me; and may I find my ſelf and all
things elſe in thee.</p>

               <head>Of MAN, Conſidered as the Son of a Sinful Father.</head>
               <p>WE have ſeen in the fore-going Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that Man, in
himſelf, is a meer Nothing, that he is made up of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Infirmity and
Darkneſs, that he receives Life, Senſe and Motion, continually from God,
that he owes to him his whole Being and all his Faculties. And therefore he is
certainly under the higheſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Love and Gratitude to God,
ſince he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſo abſolutely upon him, as he is a Creature: But if we
conſider him as the Son of a Sinful Father, and as a Sinner himſelf, we
ſhall find ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of eſſential and indiſpenſable
Duties which he owes to God, and at the ſame time ſo great a want of Power,
and ſo much unworthineſs to perform them, that ſo far is he from being
able to do his Duty, that even his Performances would be rejected, if Chriſt
our Mediator had not merited Grace for him by his Death. We muſt not then
conſider Man only as the Son of a Sinful Father, and as he is a Sinner
himſelf; but we ought always to look upon him in Jeſus Chriſt, in whom
alone we are able to pleaſe God.</p>

                  <head>The Fifth Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>MAN conſidered as the Son of a Sinful Father is a Reprobate,
a Child of Wrath, whom his Father will not ſee, and who ſhall never ſee
his Father; for he is a Child whom his Father does not love, nor will he be
belov'd by ſuch a Child.</p>
                  <p>God lov'd <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, and deſir'd to be
lov'd by him: He was willing to communicate himſelf to him, and to be in a
manner familiarly acquainted with him. He call'd to him, as he now does to us,
but with a much clearer and more intelligible Voice, I am thy Good, make me the
only Object of thy Love and Hope. At theſe words his Senſes and
Paſſions were ſilent, nor was he diſturb'd by that confus'd and
flattering noiſe, which ariſes in us even againſt our Wills, and boldly
oppoſes the dictates of Truth in our Souls. God ſpoke to him, and he did
not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur: God inlighten'd him, and he was freed from Darkneſs: God
commanded him, and he made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The Pleaſure and Joy which he
felt in ſeeing himſelf favour'd and protected by a God that would never
forſake him, if he did not firſt leave him, kept him united to his Lord by
Bonds that were never like to be broken.</p>
                  <p>God did not force <hi>Adam</hi> to love him by preingaging
Pleaſures, becauſe he would have him merit his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more ſpeedily. He
left him to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Free-will, that he might have power
to chuſe for himſelf; and he beſtow'd a due meaſure of Knowledge and
Underſtanding upon him, that he might be enabled to make a good choice. Thus
Man perceiv'd clearly what he was to do to obtain ſolid <pb n="381" facs="tcp:42160:109"/>and perfect Happineſs, and nothing could hinder him from performing
that as long as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>But he was not ſeparated from himſelf, and the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of himſelf fill'd him with a certain Joy and Pleaſure,
which made him in a manner <hi>feel</hi> that his Natural Perfection was the
cauſe of his preſent Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; for Joy ſeems to proceed naturally and
abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely from a view of our own Perfections, becauſe we do not always
think on him who operates always in us. Beſides, <hi>Adam</hi> had a Body,
and could, when he pleas'd, reliſh ſuch Pleaſures in the actual
enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Senſible Things, as made him <hi>feel</hi> that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Things were his Good. I did not make choice of this Expreſſion without
Reaſon; for he <hi>knew</hi> that God was his Good, but did not <hi>feel</hi>
it, becauſe he <hi>felt</hi> no preingaging Pleaſures in the performance of
his Duty; and on the other ſide he <hi>felt</hi> that the Objects of his
Senſes were his Good, but did not <hi>know</hi> them to be ſo, becauſe
that which <hi>is</hi> not cannot be <hi>known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Adam felt</hi> that Senſible Objects were his Good,
or imagin'd that the cauſe of his Happineſs was in himſelf; when he
taſted Pleaſure in the uſe of Corporeal Things, or rejoyc'd at the
ſight of his own Perfections, his Senſations obſcur'd the clear
percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Mind by which he <hi>knew</hi> that God was his Good: For
<hi>Senſation</hi> confounds <hi>Knowledge,</hi> becauſe it modifies the
Soul, and divides its capacity. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> who perceiv'd all theſe
things clearly, ought to have been perpetually upon his guard: He ſhould have
reſiſted the allurements of the Pleaſures which he felt, leaſt he
ſhould be diſtracted by them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd into unavoidable deſtruction:
He ſhould have ſtood firm in the preſence of God, and depended
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely on his Light. But relying too much upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42160:110"/>he ſuffered his Underſtanding to be darkened by the
reliſh of Senſual Pleaſures, or by a confus'd Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a
preſumptuous Joy; and being thus inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſunited from him who was
his true Strength, and the ſource of all his Happineſs, he was juſtly
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the revolt of thoſe Senſes to which he had voluntarily
ſubmitted. By which Puniſhment it ſeem'd that God had utterly forſaken
him, and that he would never any more vouchſafe to accept of his Love, and
had given him the Material World to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Knowledge and
Affection.</p>
                  <p>The Curſe of God that was pronounc'd againſt
<hi>Adam,</hi> is fall'n upon all the Poſterity of that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Father.
God has withdrawn his preſence from the World, and inſtead of communicating
himſelf to it, does continually thruſt it farther from him. We ſuffer
Pain when we ſeek God, but we feel all ſorts of Pleaſures when being
weary with following him through ſuch rough and troubleſome ways, we joyn
our ſelves to his Creatures. The World does not clearly <hi>perceive</hi>
that it ought to love God, and that he alone ought to be the proper Object of
its Affection; but it <hi>feels</hi> in a very lively and alluring manner, that
it ſhould love ſomething elſe beſides him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it does
not love God, but flies from him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and even is unable to turn to
him. It was ſhamefully driven out of Paradiſe in the Perſon of
<hi>Adam,</hi> it has forfeited its Title to God, and loſt the hope of Heaven
and Happineſs: It is accurſt and eternally accurſt. It is a Crime to
wiſh well to it, becauſe it is and for ever ſhall be at enmity with God.
And even it cannot wiſh well to it ſelf without doing it ſelf an injury:
For by wiſhing well to it ſelf it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to break the eſtabliſht
Order of Things, it <pb n="383" facs="tcp:42160:110"/>provokes the God of Order, and
increaſes the Hatred and Indignation of him to whom Vengeance belongs. What
can it thus do? Shall it yield it ſelf up to Fury and Deſpair, and ſeek
to be annihilated becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy God? But annihilation it ſelf is

                  <p>MAN conſidered as the Son of a Father who revolted againſt

                     <hi>Adam,</hi> in the State of Innocence, was ſtrong and
mighty, he was ſeated in an inacceſſible place, and under the protection
of God; nothing durſt aſſault him, and he was able to reſiſt every
thing. After his Fall all the Creatures made War upon him, and he was not able
to reſiſt any of them. All the Poſterity of this rebellious Parent do not
only partake of his Sin, but alſo of his Puniſhment. Let us illuſtrate
this Truth by diſtinct Ideas.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Pleaſure that rules with a Soveraign and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power in the Heart of Man, eſpecially when his Reaſon is blinded: For,
Pleaſure is the Natural Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of good, and Men cannot forbear loving
that which is good. And therefore Pleaſure is, as it were, the weight of the
Soul which inclines it by degrees, and at laſt pulls it forcibly towards the
Object that is the true or ſeeming Cauſe of that Senſation, tho' Reaſon
may oppoſe it for ſome time. <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall did not feel
thoſe preventing and preingaging <pb n="385" facs="tcp:42160:111"/>Pleaſures, which
afterwards conſtrained him to place his Affection on the Objects of his
Senſes: He enjoy'd a perfect liberty, and a full power to diſpoſe of
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He was neither forced nor enticed; but, of his own accord, and
according to the meaſure of Light that was in him, he inclined to love his
real good. But together with his Innocence he loſt his perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Not
being longer Maſter of Pleaſure, nor able to ſtop the Senſation of it,
he was at laſt inſlaved by it, and both his Underſtanding and Affections
were ſubdu'd under the tyranical dominion of Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Things. He became
altogether Earthly, a Slave to Sin, ſubject to Death, and to a thouſand
other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which it would be needleſs to deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>We are all born, like our firſt Father, chained to the
Earth: For we do all Naturally feel Pleaſure in the uſe of ſenſible
things which are the good of the Body, but we don't Naturally feel any good in
thoſe things which contribute to the perfection of the Mind: And it is this
irregularity of our Pleaſures that diſorders our Affections, and is the
moſt fruitful ſource of all our Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>And while we are in this wretched condition, we cannot by our
ſelves draw near to God, neither are we able to find in the Natural Order of
things, a Creature that is noble and pure enough, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently elevated
by the dignity of its Perſon, and by the greatneſs of its Merits, to
reconcile us to God: But we find all that we want or can deſire in the
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>This Holy Religion does continually exhort us to
Mortification, Reſignation, to a Circumciſion of the heart, and
leſſening of the weight of Sin; and it gives us alſo a Mediator, by
whoſe Merit we receive the weight <pb n="386" facs="tcp:42160:112"/>of Grace, that
victorious delight, <hi>which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> and which
draws us to God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the reſiſtance of our Paſſions
and of the Pleaſures of our Senſes. For theſe two things, the privation
of Pleaſures, and the delectation of Grace, are abſolutely neceſſary to
us in a ſtate of Sin. We muſt by a continual Mortification of our Senſes
and Paſſions, diminiſh that weight of Concupiſcence which draws us to
the Earth; and ask of God through our Mediator Chriſt Jeſus the delectation
of his Grace, without which all our endeavours to diminiſh the weight of Sin
would be in vain, for it would ſtill weight us down; and the leaſt weight
of Sin would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly draw us along with it, and keep us as it were
faſtened to the Earth, and under the dominion of our Enemies.</p>

                  <head>The Seventh Conſideration.</head>
                  <p>IT is extreamly difficult to repreſent the inward
Diſpoſitions of Mind that a Sinner ought to have; for neither the loweſt
humiliation, nor the higheſt ſelf-abhorrence, nor even annihilation it
ſelf, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſo mean wicked and empty a thing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>nothing.</hi> Annihilation would be a Bleſſing to a Sinner who is
reſerved for the Wrath that is to come: And he cannot abhor himſelf as he
ought, for 'tis God alone that can hate him as much as he deſerves.</p>
                  <p>Man as a Child of <hi>Adam</hi> is indeed a Reprobate, but he
is not ſubject to the Puniſhment of the Damned; he ought indeed to live in
perpetual ſorrow, as being deprived of his ſoveraign good, but he does not
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the extremity of Torments. The Children of a Criminal may be
juſtly deprived of all the Favours which their Father received, but they do
not deſerve an equal Puniſhment. God may with Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his
Preſence from the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> he may deny them his particular
Favours, and refuſe to be <pb n="389" facs="tcp:42160:113"/>their Recompence; and even
may, if he pleaſes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate them, ſince they are his Creatures. But it
does not ſeem agreeable to the Divine Juſtice to puniſh them with the
utmoſt ſeverity, only becauſe they are the unhappy Children of a
rebellious Father.</p>
                  <p>But the Caſe is altered when we conſider Man as a Sinner
himſelf: And God might very reaſonably exert all his Wiſdom and Power to
ſatisfie his Juſtice, if the Sinner were capable of being made the Object
of the entire Vengeance of an angry God. For ſince the Greatneſs of
Offences is meaſured by the Dignity of the Perſon that is offended, 'tis
plain that every Offence that is committed againſt God is infinite, and
deſerves an infinite Puniſhment, if Man were capable of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                  <p>Thus a Sinner conſidered without Chriſt, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worſe yet than a Damned Soul that is conſider'd with the Satisfaction of
Chriſt. For if we conſider the Satisfaction of Chriſt, it is not
neceſſary that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souls ſhould ſuffer according to their utmoſt
capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſuffering. Neither, in effect, do the Damned ſuffer all that
they are able to endure; for their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is unequal as well as their
Guilt, tho' their capacity of ſuffering be the ſame, and they deſerve to
ſuffer to the utmoſt all that they are able to bear. And therefore the
condition of a Sinner without Chriſt, is more deplorable than that of the
Damn'd; for he is a Blemiſh to the Beauty of the Univerſe, and overturns
the eſtabliſhed Order of Things as much as 'tis poſſible he ſhould
overturn it.</p>
                  <p>Such a Sinner is even more worthy of Hatred than all the
Damn'd and Devils together; for the Death of Chriſt being ſufficient to
ſupply the defects of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which the Damn'd make to the
Juſtice of <pb n="390" facs="tcp:42160:114"/>God, that Sacred Juſtice is fully
ſatisfied, and God is Glorified in the Puniſhment of the Damned
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Malice and Spight; and even their Malice it
ſelf, as the due reward of their Sins, ſerves to glorifie the Divine
Juſtice: But a Sinner without Chriſt is a Monſter whom God neither can
nor will endure; he is not capable of being comprehended in any order, neither
of Mercy nor of Juſtice. There is nothing that is Good in ſuch a Sinner;
'Tis impoſſible to think on him without horrour, and thoſe who love
Order, that inviolable Law of Spiritual Motion, can ſee nothing more worthy
hatred and deteſtation than ſuch a Creature.</p>
                  <p>I can neither hate nor humble my ſelf enough as I am a
Sinner. Even my Repentance deſerves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; for my Groans and Tears
ſerve only to renew the remembrance of my Offences. In vain do I lift up my
voice to Heaven; God hears not the Cries of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he laughs at their
Calamities, and delights in their juſt Puniſhments. As a <hi>Creature,</hi>
God hears me; as a <hi>Son of Adam,</hi> he deſpiſes me; but as a
<hi>Sinner</hi> he cannot think on me without making me the Object of his
moſt rigorous Juſtice, and puniſhing me according to the utmoſt extent
of my capacity of luſſering. How miſerable then is the condition of a
Sinner! But let us not any longer conſider him without a Redcemer.</p>

                  <p>THE Condition of Man, as a Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> and even
though we conſider him as redeem'd by Chriſt, does neceſſarily require
a ſeparation and abſtinence from all the Pleaſures of Senſe, and
Objects of Concupiſcence; for every Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> how righteous and
holy ſoever he may be ſuppos'd to be, does always feel a weight that draws
him to the Earth, and counter-ballances the effort of the weight of Grace upon
his Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now ſince the weight of Grace does not depend on us, and acts
ſo much the more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly upon us, as the weight of Concupiſcence is
leſs; 'tis plain that all Mankind is under a very ſtrict obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to
diminiſh the laſt of theſe weights, by carefully avoiding ſenſual
Pleaſures, which Naturally incline us to the love of thoſe Objects that
ſeem to cauſe them, <pb n="392" facs="tcp:42160:115"/>and by ſo doing ſtir up and
ſtrengthen the motions of Concupiſcence in us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Mortification and a depriving our ſelves of
Worldly Pleaſures are not only uſeful to cooperate with Grace, and remove
ſuch things as might obſtruct its efficacy, but are even many times
neceſſary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to deſerve Grace; and in all appearance the
ſhorteſt way to obtain it, nor do they ever fail of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it when they
proceed from a Motion of the Spirit of God, and are practiſed with due
perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>When we conſider that an unchangeable Order is the
Eſſential Rule of the Will of God, we perceive clearly that Sinners are
indiſpenſably obliged to ſuch a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Mortification; for 'tis
plain that Order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Puniſhment of Sinners.</p>
                  <p>Every Man ought to wiſh with a certain Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>Either to ſuffer, or to dye;</hi> or rather with another, <hi>Not to dye
till he has ſuffered much.</hi> For every one who loves Order, who prefers
the Will of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own, who has regard to the Beauty of the
Univerſe, not that viſible Beauty which is the Object of our Senſes, but
the intelligible Beauty which can be only perceived by our Minds; every one I
ſay, that conſiders himſelf as a part of the Works of God, and who places
not his chief end in himſelf, nor thinks it his Duty to love himſelf more
than God, ought to conform himſelf to the Will of his <hi>All.</hi> He ought
to undertake the quarrel of God, and inſpir'd with a holy zeal for the
ſatisfaction of his Juſtice, exerciſe a neceſſary ſeverity
againſt himſelf; a ſeverity which will reſtore him to a ſtate of
Order, ſo much the more quickly as he ſhall exerciſe it more voluntarily:
For, if the puniſhment of Sin were not voluntary it would neceſſarily be
eternal.</p>

                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:42160:115"/>If we conſider'd that Pleaſure is a
recompence, which God alone is capable of producing in us; and that he has
obliged himſelf by the Order of Nature, which is nothing elſe but the
Eternal Decrees of his Will, to make us feel Pleaſure, as often as the Bodies
that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us ſhall produce in our Body ſuch motions as are uſeful
for its preſervation: If we conſidered this, I ſay, we ſhould be fully
convinced that it is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſhameful impudence to make uſe of
the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of the Decrees of a Juſt God to oblige him to reward
us, at the ſame time that we deſerve to be puniſhed as Sinners, and even
for thoſe Crimes which we are then actually committing againſt God. For it
is certainly a thing that cannot be reflected on without horrour and amazement;
<hi>viz.</hi> that we make the goodneſs of God favour our Paſſions, and
in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner force the God of order to reward diſorder.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider on the other ſide, that Pain is a
puniſhment which God alone is capable of inflicting on us, and that he has
obliged himſelf, by the ſame order of Nature, to make us ſenſible of
Pain as often as the Bodies which ſurround us ſhall produce ſuch motions
in our Bodies as are contrary to its preſervation; we then can no longer
doubt but that a Sinner who willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmits to the order of Juſtice, and
makes uſe of the immutability of the Divine Will, only that he may be
re-eſtabliſh'd in a ſtate of order, who, if I may be allowed to uſe
that expreſſion, reconciles God with God, and natural order with
eſſential and neceſſary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and who, knowing himſelf to be a
Sinner, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges God in purſuance of his unalterable Decrees to treat him
according to his deſerts; we cannot doubt, I ſay, but that ſuch a Sinner
ſhall certainly draw upon himſelf the favourable Mercy of ſo good a God
as he <pb n="394" facs="tcp:42160:116"/>whom we adore. For, ſuch a Sinner is truly
amiable; he augments the beauty of the Univerſe; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with all his
might to re-enter into a ſtate of order, and he does effectually re-enter
into it, his ſufferings being united to thoſe of Chriſt who alone is an
atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is able to compaſs the glorious deſign of the general
reſtoration of all things.</p>
                  <p>How great is the difference between a voluptuous and a
repenting Sinner! Let us endeavour once more to give a lively Idea of it. A
voluptuous perſon is a monſter who breaks all order, and ſpoils the
beauty of the Univerſe; whereas a true penitent re-eſtabliſhes a ſtate
of order, and reſtores to the Univerſe what he hath taken from it. A
voluptuous Man is a Traytor who abuſes the goodneſs of his Soveraign, and
who, being acquainted with his deſigns, does maliciouſly take advantages
from them, to oblige him to actions that are unworthy of him; but a penitent
Sinner is a faithful Servant who ſtudies the will of his Maſter, and is
willing to undergo any ſufferings that it may be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; one who makes
ſuch a prudent uſe of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he has of his Lord's inclinations,
that he obliges him in Juſtice to make him his Favourite. Finally, a
voluptuous Man is a Malefactor who is perpetually committing new crimes; an
obdurate Sinner who drinks up iniquity like water, and rejoyces in his
wickedneſs; a caſt Devil whoſe doom is not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd; and a fatted
Victim reſerv'd for the day of the Lord's vengeance, and to be the fuel of
inextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable flames. On the other ſide, a true Penitent is a juſt
perſon who fears Sin more than he loves Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; an humble and contrite
Soul that is ſtill purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in bitterneſs and pain; a burnt
ſacrifice of Love; a ſacrifice that is too pleaſing and too accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able 
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42160:116"/>to the God to whom it is made to remain in the order of
Juſtice, and which ſhall therefore be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tranſlated to that of
Mercy; for, its puniſhment, being voluntary, cannot continue for ever.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not then delude our ſelves by imagining that
Chriſt came into the World to free us from our obligations to Repentance.
Chriſt did not come to overturn the order of things: The deſign of his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to ſuffer with Sinners, by his ſufferings to ſanctifie their
Repentance, and render it well-pleaſing to God. He came to bear by the
greatneſs of his Power that which Men could not bear by reaſon of the
weakneſs of their Nature, the finiteneſs of their Being and unworthineſs
of their Perſons. But he came not to excuſe them from Repentance; far from
that, he encourages them to ſuffer by his own Example, ſtrengthens them by
his Grace, and inſtructs them by his Doctrine: For he has aſſured us that
none but thoſe who follow him to the Death ſhall enjoy that Life which he
merited for us by the loſs of his own. If any Man, ſays he, would riſe
again with me, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his own Life, let him bear the inſtrument of
his puniſhment, let him take up his Croſs and follow me; for he that would
ſave his Life ſhall loſe it. Nay, he even rebukes ſharply the
greateſt of his Apoſtles, becauſe he would have diſſwaded him from
ſuffering; he calls him Satan, and commands him out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:

                     <p>O LORD, whoſe Will is ever effectual, and all whoſe
Decrees are unchangeable, it is of thy bounty that we feel Pleaſure in the
uſe of ſenſible things; but ungrateful Man loves that falſe good, and
deſpiſes the true cauſe of his Happineſs; or rather, he is ignorant
that thou, O Lord, alone art able to operate in him. It was wiſely ordered by
thy Providence, that Man ſhould be able to diſcern, by ſhort and evident
Proofs, whether he ſhould uſe or avoid the Bodies that ſurround him, that
he might not be obliged to turn from thee, nor to ſix his Mind upon thy
Creatures. But he has abuſed thy Mercy to his own deſtruction; for thou, O
God, art <hi>not in all his thoughts:</hi> He imagines that <hi>matter</hi> is
the cauſe of all the Pleaſure which he feels, and therefore yields
himſelf a ſlave to it, and makes it the only Object of his Thoughts and
Affections. Thus what thou hadſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to preſerve the Righteous Man
in his Rightcouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſerves now to harden the Wicked in their
Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Is it juſt thou ſhouldſt work a Miracle for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wretch, O God? No, Lord, let thy Decrees remain fixt for ever; and woe be to
thoſe that tempt thee. Let Men ſhun Poyſon if they would avoid Death.
They can diſcern that Poyſon, for thou haſt taught them to know and avoid
it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:42160:117"/>But, O thou Juſt and Merciful God,
who dealeſt Righteouſly with thy Creatures, how ſhall we be able to hate
Pleaſure? How hate what thou cauſeſt us to love? It is juſt that we
ſuffer as Sinners; but can we love Pain which thou ſeemeſt to make us
hate by an invincible Impreſſion? O Lord, whoſe Wiſdom is infinite,
enable us perfectly to underſtand that thou art not contrary to thy ſelf,
and that thy Wills do not imply contradiction; that Pleaſure, in it ſelf,
is not abſolutely bad, and that the true cauſe that produces it, really
deſerves and ought to be belov'd and reſpected; belov'd with all our Heart
and Soul, and reſpected ſo as not to be conſtrain'd, in conſequence of
his Will, to gratifie us, when, abſolutely ſpeaking, be ſhould puniſh
us.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, who hideſt thy ſelf from our mortal Eyes,
cauſe thy ſtrength, and the efficacy of thy will to exert themſelves, and
do thou clearly and inceſſantly convince us that the Bodies which are on
all ſides about us are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incapable of doing us either good or
harm. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Men will love none but thee when they come to know that thou
alone art able to do them good, and perhaps they will fear none but thee when
they ſhall have rightly underſtood that thou alone haſt ſufficient
ſtrength and power to cauſe them to ſuffer Pain.</p>
                     <p>But I beſeech thee, O my God, to deal with me in a more
ſafe and merciful manner. I know that thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not my good, yet I
love them: I am convinc'd that whatever is round me cannot penetrate me, yet my
Heart inſenſibly opens it ſelf, and expects to receive from the vileſt
of thy Creatures what thou alone art able to give me. Therefore, O Lord, be
pleaſed out of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimte Mercy, to deal with me in a more ſafe manner
than thou doſt with thoſe who follow the Dictates of their Love. Oh ſet
me apart from thy Creatures ſince they <pb n="398" facs="tcp:42160:118"/>turn my Heart
from thee. Draw my Eyes from fixing themſelves on ſenſible Objects,
ſince I miſtake them for thee; or rather, ſince I love them inſtead of
thee. This is the ſureſt means to remedy the diſorders in my Heart.</p>
                     <p>All my Philoſophy is not ſufficient to regulate my Love,
and can only ſerve to accuſe and confound me before thee. It teaches me
that I make uſe of the Order, to overthrow the Order; that I miſemploy thy
Gifts by promoting what is ill; and that I make uſe of the immutability of
thy Decrees meerly to reward Rebellion and other Crimes: It plainly ſhows me
my Impiety and Injuſtice; but leaves me plung'd in it. I am ſtricken with
horrour when I think on my ſelf, yet I cannot forbear loving my ſelf. So I
procure thoſe Pleaſures to my ſelf which make me happy, at leaſt while
I enjoy them. O God, how ſtupid and ſenſleſs am I not! I love my ſelf
for a Moment, and ruine my ſelf for a whole Eternity: But I have a feeling
ſence of that Moment, and I have none of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. 'Tis true I think on it,
and the Thought diſturbs my Joy; but alas! Pleaſure, though never ſo
weaken'd by my Reflections, eaſily draws after its ſelf a Heart which it
has already put into motion. Deprive me then, O my God, of all the Objects that
flatter my Senſes and diſorder my Reaſon. While, as being the Author of
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thou makeſt me ſeel Pleaſure in the uſe of thoſe Objects, do
thou, as thou art the Author of Grace, make me loath and abhor them. And I
beſeech thee out of the abundance of thy Mercies, that at ſuch times as
Pains are voluntary, thou mayſt make me ſuffer thoſe which my Crimes
deſerve. O God, who canſt not let ſin remain impuniſhed, make me
continually return to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the Order. Form me upon the model of
thy <pb n="399" facs="tcp:42160:118"/>Son, crucifie me with him, and let his Croſs, that
is only folly and weakneſs to the Eyes of Man, be all my Strength, all my
Wiſdom and all my Joy.</p>
                     <p>O Jeſus! who waſt nail'd on the Croſs for my ſins, I
am thine; nail and fix me there with thee; crucifie my Fleſh with its
Paſſions and unruly Deſires; deſtroy this body of Sin, or by thy Grace
deliver me from the ſtreſs of it that continually preſſes upon my Mind.
<hi>We are baptized in thy Death: We are dead to all the things of this World:
We are even buried with thee through Baptiſm: Our old Man,</hi> according to
thy great Apoſtle, <hi>was crucified with thee, that the body of ſin might
be deſtroy'd.</hi> And wilt thou, O Lord, ſuffer this Old Man to live
again, and this Body of Sin to ſubſiſt? O Saviour of the World, do thou
finiſh the work which thou haſt begun! Continue to ſuffer in thy Members:
Do thou in our Fleſh ſiniſh the Sacrifice which thou haſt begun in
<hi>Abel,</hi> which thou didſt continue in the Patriarchs and Prophets, and
to which thou wilt not put an end but by the Death of the laſt Member of thy
Body, that is to be the laſt Saint whom thou wilt give to thy Church.</p>
                     <p>O thou Bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt, thou Love of the
Father and of the Son, diffuſe thy Charity through our Hearts, drive the
ſervile fear of Slaves out of our Minds, and fill us with that Fear that is
found in the Children, and which gives a Right to the Inheritance of our
Father. Come, O thou Spirit of Comfort, ſoften the bitterneſs and
diſtaſte which we find in Repentance; make us partake of the Sufferings of
Chriſt, that we may alſo be made partakers of his Glory. But give 
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42160:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>us at the ſame time ſome of that Heavenly Fire
which thou didſt ſhower down on the Apoſtles; that Fire which kindled in
them an ardent Zeal to preach the Croſs of Chriſt without Fear, and to
ſuffer joyfully the ſhame of Whipping, the ſtreſs of Torments, and
Death it ſelf for Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Amen.</hi>
